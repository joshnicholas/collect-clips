They said that they were collaborative. They were actually very secretive,’ she says.Hao spent the next five years following the growth of OpenAI, as it shifted to pursue – in her words – a growth-at-all-costs model.

On the other, she argues, it has come at a severe cost – to the people whose labour it relies on to operate, and to the planet.In fact, as she describes in her new book, Empire of AI: Inside the reckless race for total domination, it makes sense to think of OpenAI not as a company, but more akin to empires of old",2025-06-01,Presented by Michael Safi with Karen Hao; produced by Hattie Moir and Ivor Manley; executive producer Sami Kent
