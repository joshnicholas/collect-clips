Gavin Newsom consistently polls at the top of the potential nominees, and it’s interesting,” she said.  “Over the last couple of months, (he’s been) using social media, he’s tried to rebrand himself as dark woke take on Trump, use the memes that the Trump administration uses, and just use it against them, and he’s been remarkably successful.  “I think he’s probably one of the more threatening candidates that could potentially be in the (presidential) race.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFskgmaxwig,Sky News Australia

2025-10-28T00:45:26+00:00,King Charles heckled over brother Prince Andrew | ABC NEWS,"King Charles was heckled by a protester on Monday over his brother Prince Andrew's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The king was greeting royal fans during a cathedral visit in Britain.  ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?,"" the man could be heard shouting outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England, close to Birmingham.  Although Prince Andrew, 65, said this month that he would give up using his title of Duke of York after years of scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein, questions about him — and what the royals knew of events — have intensified since.  The contents of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, have triggered renewed backlash over the issue this month.  Andrew has always denied Giuffre's account. In 2022, he made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.  British police are looking into media reports that in 2011 Andrew had asked one of his police officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre.  The protester could also be heard saying: ""Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? ... Should the MPs (members of parliament) be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?""  The monarch ignored the protester and carried on engaging with other members of the public.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

No one may be elected to the US presidency a third time, according to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution.

Opponents have disputed whether this would be legal. Referring to Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump also said they were ""great people"" who could run for the office.

The constitution's 22nd amendment prevents anyone from being elected to the office of president more than twice. However, this hasn't stopped rampant speculation that Trump will mount a move to either remain in office in 2028, or find a legal workaround to permit a third tilt at the presidency.  Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked point-blank if he would rule out a third run. ""Am I ruling it out? You tell me,"" he responded. Trump did, however, address one popularly held theory that he could run as Vice President behind JD Vance, with Vance immediately stepping down after winning an election. Despite that too being constitutionally forbidden, Trump said he would not do it because ""it's too cute.""
