Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump defended the move as ensuring “100 per cent safety” for passengers, while dismissing concerns about mounting flight delays and unpaid air traffic controllers.  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA chief Bryan Bedford said the cuts, expected to affect major hubs including New York, Washington DC, Chicago and Los Angeles, aim to reduce pressure on fatigued staff who have gone more than a month without pay.  The shutdown, now in its 36th day, has already caused widespread airport disruptions and staffing shortages.   Trump again urged Senate Republicans to scrap the filibuster rule to pass legislation and took a swipe at outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling her “an evil woman who did a poor job.”  Join the conversation and follow us on: Twitter: http://twitter.com/10NewsAU Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/10NewsAU/ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/10NewsAU/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@10NewsAU 10 News airs at 5pm, seven nights a week in your local market on Network 10.

2025-11-06T07:45:03+00:00,"Building up, not out is key to solving housing supply crisis, says Grattan Institute | The Business","Australia needs around 250,000 new homes to be built a year over the next four years to reach the 1.2 million home government target. 176,000 homes were built in the first year of the National Housing Accord. Builders and experts agree building out isn't enough. Now the prominent think-tank The Grattan Institute says building up is part of the solution. Housing and economic security programme director at the Grattan Institute, Brendan Coates says Australian cities are some of the least dense of their size in the world. ""We haven't allowed enough housing in those areas where Australians most want to live in those inner and middle ring suburbs of our capital cities,"" he says. Grattan wants a green light for three story dwellings on every residential block, adding 67,000 new homes a year and saving $100,000 a house. However the building industry says there's a drastic short fall of skilled labour. Supervisor at McDonald Jones Homes, Brian Skinner says ""Skilled labour is still the number one issue that the building industry, not only in New South Wales but across Australia, needs to tackle."" Land prices have also been flagged as a barrier to building more homes. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-11-05T23:21:41+00:00,Trump Attacks Zohran Mamdani’s Historic NYC Win As Democrats Sweep Major US Races | 10 News,"US President Donald Trump has attacked Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani’s landmark victory in New York City, calling it a loss of “sovereignty”.  Speaking at a Miami forum marking a year since his re-election, Trump praised his economic record, saying, “We have the greatest economy right now. A lot of people don’t see that,” but offered few new ideas, instead revisiting familiar themes of crime, immigration and opposition to transgender rights.  His remarks came after Democrats swept key races across the country, winning governorships in New Jersey and Virginia, the mayoralty in New York City, and a major California ballot initiative to redraw congressional districts in response to Republican-led efforts elsewhere.  While Trump warned Mamdani’s win showed the rise of “radical policies,” observers say it signals a deepening appetite for progressive change, with voters embracing Mamdani’s platform of wealth redistribution, free childcare and expanded public services.

2025-11-04T08:30:30+00:00,Why any rate relief for borrowers is now well into next year | The Business | ABC NEWS,"A Melbourne Cup rate cut from the Reserve Bank was a non-starter. After three cuts this year, the RBA board kept the cash rate on hold at 3.6 per cent with its Governor Michele Bullock citing hotter-than-expected inflation. The RBA now says it's on the fence when it comes to its next interest rate move.  But some economists say any rate relief for borrowers won't happen until at least the middle of 2026. Economist Chris Richardson says ""the last mile in the fight against inflation is pretty tough"" for most central banks. Cost of living pressures are being driven by surging electricity prices and housing, with property prices rising at the fastest pace in more than two years. For borrowers, Canstar's Sally Tindall says there's been a surge in refinancing -- with roughly a thousand borrowers switching lenders each day. Ms Tindall says the average owner occupier's variable is around 5.5 per cent, but a competitive rate would be below 5.25 per cent. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-11-04T08:03:36+00:00,Is the government's plan to give free power not as good as it seems? | The Business | ABC NEWS,"From July next year, households will have access to at least three free hours of power as long as they take up the default market offer and have a smart meter. The government's newly announced Solar Sharer Scheme will force retailers to make it available to consumers in NSW, South East Queensland, and South Australia. The aim is to soak up the nation's abundant daytime solar power, stabilising the grid and lowering power prices in peak periods. The founder of SolarQuotes, now owned by Origin Energy, Finn Peacock says its a great headline, but the devil is in the detail. "" I think its a good idea to reduce the cost of electricity during the day, to encourage more electricity during the day, but I think forcing retailers to offer it for free for three hours is only likely to push up other costs for consumers."" Power retailers say they've been blindsided and shocked by the scheme that puts smaller operators under pressure. Chief Executive Officer at the Australian Energy Council says ""Generally the charge that comes from the companies that operate the poles are wires still exists for that middle of the day but retailers are effectively covering that cost in the middle of the day."" she says "" For smaller retailers in particular we do need to think carefully about whether they can actually cover those costs.

Firefighters were forced to retreat at one point when a second section of the 13th-century Torre dei Conti gave way, sending dust and debris into the air near the Colosseum and Roman Forum.  One worker was freed in critical condition, while three others were rescued unharmed and no bystanders were injured.  Emergency crews are now stabilising the crumbling tower to prevent further collapse.

Survivors who escaped to Tawila say fighters rounded up civilians, separated men from women and shot detainees after hurling racial slurs, with satellite analysis suggesting systematic ethnic-based killings.  Reuters and UN-verified videos show RSF fighters shooting captives and bodies scattered across streets, despite RSF denials and claims of “media exaggeration”.  Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab says violence mirrors early stages of the Rwandan genocide, describing “door-to-door clearance operations” targeting non-Arab communities.

Born into a life of privilege and duty, destined to serve the Crown as a senior member of the Royal Family. But the gilded life masked a very different one in private.

New AFP Commissioner Krissy Barrett used her first speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday to announce the creation of Taskforce Pompilid, which will use the technology amongst a raft of measures to crack down on decentralised online crime networks.    The AFP is warning that young girls are being ""hunted, stalked and drawn-in"" by men using online networks to coerce them into carrying out serious acts of violence on themselves, their siblings or pets, in a ""twisted type of gamification"".  The Commissioner also offered practical steps to keep children out of harm's way.  ""Let kids know they have the right to feel safe online and, if something feels uncomfortable, they can leave a chat at any time and tell a safe adult.   You can encourage safe conversations by talking regularly about online activities and apps, encouraging critical thinking, and reassuring kids that they won't be punished for coming forward if they think they have done something wrong.   Also, you can look out for warning signs that include self-harm, changes in eating or sleeping habits, sudden withdrawal from friends, families or activities, use of extreme behaviour, extreme language or symbols, and rejection of previously held morals.   Importantly, there are really practical and easy resources available, including how to make a report about child exploitation, at the AFP-led Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation website. That's www.acce.gov.au"". she said.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

The ""trimmed mean"" for the September quarter, which strips out the most volatile price moves up and down, came in at 1 per cent. The headline number was 1.3 per cent. On an annual basis, the trimmed mean lifted to the top of the RBA's target band at 3 per cent. It was much hotter than the RBA and market economists were expecting, squashing hopes of a rate cut next week. In fact, NAB chief economist Sally Auld told The Business NAB isn't expecting another rate cut until mid-2026. ""No rate cuts for the rest of this year, likely no rate cuts in the first quarter of next year, but we do have one more rate cut in our profile but not until May of 2026,"" She said.

2025-10-28T00:45:26+00:00,King Charles heckled over brother Prince Andrew | ABC NEWS,"King Charles was heckled by a protester on Monday over his brother Prince Andrew's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The king was greeting royal fans during a cathedral visit in Britain.  ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?,"" the man could be heard shouting outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England, close to Birmingham.  Although Prince Andrew, 65, said this month that he would give up using his title of Duke of York after years of scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein, questions about him — and what the royals knew of events — have intensified since.  The contents of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, have triggered renewed backlash over the issue this month.  Andrew has always denied Giuffre's account. In 2022, he made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.  British police are looking into media reports that in 2011 Andrew had asked one of his police officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre.  The protester could also be heard saying: ""Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? ... Should the MPs (members of parliament) be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?""  The monarch ignored the protester and carried on engaging with other members of the public.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-10-27T23:36:39+00:00,King Charles Heckled Over Prince Andrew’s Ties To Epstein Outside Cathedral | 10 News,"King Charles was heckled by a protester over Prince Andrew’s ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when greeting royal fans outside Lichfield Cathedral in north-west England. ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?"" the man could be heard shouting at the monarch.  “Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew, Sir?""  Although Prince Andrew recently said that he would give up using his title of Duke of York after years of scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein, questions about him and what the royals knew of events have grown.  Virginia Giuffre’s memoir, in which she accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, has added fuel to the fire.  The prince has always denied her account.  The monarch paid no attention to the protester and carried on engaging with other members of the public.

2025-10-27T23:15:03+00:00,Donald Trump says he 'would love' third term | ABC NEWS,"US President Donald Trump ruled out running for the vice presidency in the 2028 election, an approach some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican president to serve an additional term in office. The remarks were Trump's latest on the subject, which he has teased in public remarks and with ""Trump 2028"" hats he hands out at the White House. No one may be elected to the US presidency a third time, according to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. Some have suggested that one way around this prohibition would be for Trump to stand as vice president, while another candidate stood for president and resigned, letting Trump again assume the presidency. Opponents have disputed whether this would be legal. Referring to Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump also said they were ""great people"" who could run for the office.

The constitution's 22nd amendment prevents anyone from being elected to the office of president more than twice. However, this hasn't stopped rampant speculation that Trump will mount a move to either remain in office in 2028, or find a legal workaround to permit a third tilt at the presidency.  Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked point-blank if he would rule out a third run. ""Am I ruling it out? You tell me,"" he responded. Trump did, however, address one popularly held theory that he could run as Vice President behind JD Vance, with Vance immediately stepping down after winning an election. Despite that too being constitutionally forbidden, Trump said he would not do it because ""it's too cute.""
