2025-11-30T08:04:53+00:00,"Western Sydney Explosion Fire, Airport Travel Chaos Continues, Dual Protests In Melbourne | 10 News+","Airports across Australia faced another morning of chaos after Border Force computers experienced a system outage, forcing officials to process travellers manually. The outage impacted automated passport gates, so every inbound and outbound international passenger was affected. It follows an Airbus software glitch which saw mass cancellations and delays of Jetstar flights, which was resolved today.  An anti-immigration protest organised by Put Australia First marched along Flinders St in Melbourne’s CBD, with heavy police presence as a counter-rally unfolded nearby at the State Library of Victoria. One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson addressed the anti-immigration rally, and was interrupted by a counter-protestor with a loudspeaker, who was promptly ordered to move on by police.  A new television ad in Ireland is warning parents about the dangers of oversharing about their children on social media. The campaign, called ‘Pause Before You Post’ explains that digital information from photos can be used for predators to learn specific details about kids, and just 20 images is enough to build a convincing AI deepfake of a child.  One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson’s donning of the burka was widely condemned, but eye-catching political stunts are nothing new in Australia. To gain attention, politicians have performed stunts with wild costumes that cause offence, but more often than not, they are silly and sometimes plain absurd. Network Political Editor Ashleigh Raper takes a look back at the history of political stunts for 10 News+.

2025-11-27T08:28:11+00:00,Banking regulator to cap home loans amid housing boom | The Business | ABC NEWS,"The banking regulator will impose new restrictions on home loans from early next year to limit the number of ""high-risk"" large loans being issued to customers. APRA is ordering the institutions under its supervision to limit high debt-to-income loans to 20 per cent of all new loans approved. The regulator says the 20 per cent cap will apply separately to investor and owner-occupier loans, to avoid the risk of investors ""crowding out"" owner-occupier buyers. A high debt-to-income loan is defined as one where the total amount borrowed is more than six times the borrower's annual household income. The new cap on high debt-to-income loans takes effect on February 1. Alicia Barry spoke with APRA chair, John Lonsdale, in his first TV interview. He says; ""we're particularly targeting high debt to income lending, if we're successful at that, we'd expect good quality lending to keep happening through the economy and I think that's good for borrowers of all sorts.""  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-27/banking-regulator-apra-imposes-home-loan-caps/106058604  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-11-26T19:00:34+00:00,"Rate hikes possible in 2026, warns CBA chief economist | The Business | ABC NEWS","Inflation accelerated more than expected in the year to October, according to new monthly figures. The measure the Reserve Bank looks closely at, the trimmed mean rose to 3.3 per cent, which is now higher than its target range. The RBA's target range is between 2-3 per cent. Headline inflation, at 3.8 per cent came in higher than market expectations, 3.6 per cent. Some economists think the easing cycle over, while others are warning of volatility in the data.  Commonwealth Bank's chief economist Luke Yeaman is warning that Australia's economy is running close to full speed, creating a headache for the Reserve Bank.  He says stronger growth, a resilient labour market, rising house prices and an inflation surprise in the September quarter and October monthly quarters have taken rate cuts off the table and raised the risk of hikes in 2026.  He thinks Australia is ""getting close to our economic speed limit"", with potential growth now lower.   Speaking to ABC TV's The Business, Mr Yeaman said ""the question is where to from here into 2026? Do they (the RBA) need to take out a little bit more insurance to keep inflation under control?""  ""Our view is that when you look through the inflation surprises that we've had some of those factors driving that are temporary, and some of them look a little more persistent, but there are definitely some temporary factors at play too. So we're still hopeful that as we move into 2026, we'll start to see the economy stabilise and inflation come back towards the target band. But there are certainly risks mounting on the upside.""  Even though energy prices have rose on an annual basis by 37 per cent to October, Mr Yeaman says while it impacts households, the Reserve Bank isn't concerned about energy prices, they're ""looking through it"". #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

The phenomenon sparked widespread concern among parents, teachers and church leaders who worried about children gambling with cards, stealing from each other, and spending lunch money on rare cards worth up to $85.

Authorities say communities should remain alert, as Cyclone Fina continues to evolve and warn it may bring further severe weather in the coming days.

2025-11-19T19:01:13+00:00,"House prices and rents to keep rising in 2026, says Domain | The Business | ABC NEWS","A gradual rise in household incomes is one reason why house prices are expected to reach record highs in all capital cities by the end of next year.  That's according to Domain's forecast report for 2026. It shows house prices will rise by 6 per cent across the capitals, compared to 9 per cent this year.  Units will go up by 5 per cent, in a market that's expected to be more balanced and policy-driven. Domain's chief of research and economics Nicola Powell says the forecast for growth is largely due to the expansion of the first home guarantee scheme. She says the first half of next year will likely see first home buyers competing with investors, but as capital growth starts to slow, investors will likely pull back. Domain's report reveals the biggest increase in house prices will be seen in the most rate-sensitive cities of Sydney and Melbourne.  Nicola Powell says Sydney's median house price is expected to hit $1.9 million in 2026, and setting a pathway for a $2 million median house price in Sydney by 2027. Rental price growth is also forecast across all capital cities, however Nicola Powell says she would describe the projects as modest and in line with inflation. ""We're expecting a little bit of an uptick in the rate of rental price growth in Sydney and Melbourne for house rents, but in most of our capital cities, we're expecting unit rents to grow faster than house rents"", she says. ""That really is this steer towards more affordable rental properties, smaller rental properties because we know the rental market has been extremely strained over recent years."" #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

However, the increase was down on the same period last year and an economist says workers can expect real wages to fall again next year. Wage rises were stronger for workers in the public sector, led by pay rises for employees of state and local governments. The data alleviates any pressure on the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates.  William Buck chief economist Besa Deda thinks there's a possibility of one more cut in the second half of 2026.  The ABS published a second set of monthly numbers, estimating the total wages and salaries paid by employers to their staff in September.  Payments totalled $108.8 billion, driven higher by bonuses in the mining, utilities, retail, media and financial services sectors, which are often paid in September, in response to financial year targets.  However, the 5.3 per cent annual growth in total wages and salaries paid to employees was down from the 6.1 per cent rise recorded over the year to September 2024. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-19/abs-wage-price-index-figures-released-september-quarter/106026360  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-11-17T07:57:10+00:00,Calls to change ASX trading rules after DroneShield share crash | The Business | ABC NEWS,"After running a dizzying rally this year, DroneShield saw its stock plunge by more than 30 per cent in a day on November 13.  The sell-off came after the news the chief executive Oleg Vornik, chair Peter James and director Jethro Marks offloaded all of their shares in the counter drone technology company.  The company announced the share sales on November 12 after a previous announcement on November 5, that Oleg Vornik, Peter James and Jethro Marks had received performance share options, triggered by the company achieving milestone of $200 million in cash receipts over a 12-month rolling period. They converted the majority of their performance options to ordinary shares, then sold them between November 6 and November 12. Experts say sales like this can affect investor confidence. International corporate governance and sustainability expert Thomas Clarke says there are no rules against it but he thinks there ""should be a window to prevent directors selling out the bulk of their shares or a very large proportion of their shares so soon after an announcement.""  Investors also are calling for changes to regulations.   DroneShield told the market, the share sales by the CEO and others were unrelated to the growth trajectory of the company, which it said remains strong, as highlighted in the recent quarterly market update. Directors also retain a stake in the company through vested options, but CEO Oleg Vornik holds less than 200,000 vested share options out of the 15 million he was awarded.  DroneShield shares have surged more than 200 per cent this year.  The share price picked up 12 per cent on Monday. ABC contacted Peter James and Jethro Marks through DroneShield and Oleg Vornik for comment. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigators raided homes and businesses across Darwin on Friday after receiving a tip-off from the Department of Defence about the alleged crime. The AFP alleges a 48-year-old Commonwealth Defence employee, his 40-year-old wife, and a 41-year-old male director of a local construction firm had conspired to channel nearly $71 million of Defence building contracts to their own company. During the raids, investigators seized $30,000 in cash, documents, electronic devices, jewellery and a small quantity of illicit drugs, which the AFP suspects is cocaine. In a statement, the AFP alleged that the group ""were involved in a conspiracy to influence the awarding of tenders to their company, with the intention of dishonestly gaining a benefit from the Commonwealth, namely the Department of Defence"".

Protesters demanded access to the UN compound where thousands of delegates from countries around the world are attending this year's UN climate summit in the Amazon city of Belem, Brazil.  Some waved flags with slogans calling for land rights or carried signs saying, ""Our land is not for sale.""  Security guards pushed the protesters back and used tables to barricade the entrance. A Reuters witness saw one security guard being rushed away in a wheelchair while clutching his stomach.  Another guard with a fresh cut above his eye told Reuters he had been hit in the head by a heavy drumstick thrown from the crowd. Security confiscated several long, heavy sticks.  The protesters dispersed shortly after the clash. They had been in a group of hundreds who marched to the venue.  Security guards later allowed delegates to exit the venue, having earlier asked them to move back inside until the area was clear. Within the compound, the United Nations is responsible for security.  ""Earlier this evening, a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.  ""Brazilian and UN security personnel took protective actions to secure the venue, following all established security protocols. Brazilian and UN authorities are investigating the incident. The venue is fully secured, and COP negotiations continue.""  Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Indigenous communities as key players in this year's COP30 negotiations.

Australians are expected to spend a record $6.8 billion over the Black Friday–Cyber Monday weekend, according to research from the Australian Retailers Association (ARA) in partnership with Roy Morgan. That's a 4 per cent increase on last year. Overall, about 6 million Australians are expected to take part in Black Friday sales this year. On average, they will fork out $804 each. Recent interest rate cuts have delivered a greater sense of optimism. Research from Westpac and the Melbourne Institute shows consumer sentiment surged in November by almost 13 per cent. It's the first time that optimists have outnumbered pessimists in years. Other data from Shopify shows more Australians are using artificial intelligence to help guide purchases. Retailers are reaping the rewards, as Australians continue to splash cash, both online and in store.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

In Sulfur Cave, straddling the Greek–Albanian border, lies what could be the largest spider web ever found, a recent study has revealed. After first discovering the colonial spider community in 2022, researchers now estimate the more than 100-square-metre web is home to around 110,000 spiders. Two different species inhabit the web, each genetically distinct from their relatives on the surface.  The researchers also say it's the first time these usually solitary spiders have been seen forming colonies, a finding the team describes as ""extraordinary."" It's thought the reason for the Sulfur Cave's popularity with spiders is the huge number of midges that also dwell in its depths, offering a plentiful food source for the arachnids.

2025-11-06T07:45:03+00:00,"Building up, not out is key to solving housing supply crisis, says Grattan Institute | The Business","Australia needs around 250,000 new homes to be built a year over the next four years to reach the 1.2 million home government target. 176,000 homes were built in the first year of the National Housing Accord. Builders and experts agree building out isn't enough. Now the prominent think-tank The Grattan Institute says building up is part of the solution. Housing and economic security programme director at the Grattan Institute, Brendan Coates says Australian cities are some of the least dense of their size in the world. ""We haven't allowed enough housing in those areas where Australians most want to live in those inner and middle ring suburbs of our capital cities,"" he says. Grattan wants a green light for three story dwellings on every residential block, adding 67,000 new homes a year and saving $100,000 a house. However the building industry says there's a drastic short fall of skilled labour. Supervisor at McDonald Jones Homes, Brian Skinner says ""Skilled labour is still the number one issue that the building industry, not only in New South Wales but across Australia, needs to tackle."" Land prices have also been flagged as a barrier to building more homes. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-11-05T23:21:41+00:00,Trump Attacks Zohran Mamdani’s Historic NYC Win As Democrats Sweep Major US Races | 10 News,"US President Donald Trump has attacked Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani’s landmark victory in New York City, calling it a loss of “sovereignty”.  Speaking at a Miami forum marking a year since his re-election, Trump praised his economic record, saying, “We have the greatest economy right now. A lot of people don’t see that,” but offered few new ideas, instead revisiting familiar themes of crime, immigration and opposition to transgender rights.  His remarks came after Democrats swept key races across the country, winning governorships in New Jersey and Virginia, the mayoralty in New York City, and a major California ballot initiative to redraw congressional districts in response to Republican-led efforts elsewhere.  While Trump warned Mamdani’s win showed the rise of “radical policies,” observers say it signals a deepening appetite for progressive change, with voters embracing Mamdani’s platform of wealth redistribution, free childcare and expanded public services.

2025-11-05T01:11:34+00:00,World Reacts As Former US Vice-President Dick Cheney Dies Aged 84 | 10 News,"Former US vice-president Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful and controversial figures in modern American politics, has died aged 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiovascular disease.  A key architect of the Iraq War and post-9/11 security agenda, he expanded presidential power, defended interrogation tactics critics labelled torture, and often clashed with senior Bush officials.  Cheney later broke with his party to condemn Donald Trump, warning he posed a threat to US democracy, with Mr Trump yet to comment on his passing.  Reactions have poured in from across the globe, reflecting deep divisions over his legacy and influence.  Praised by George W Bush as a patriot and “among the finest public servants,” he leaves behind a fiercely debated legacy that shaped US foreign policy for decades.

2025-11-04T08:30:30+00:00,Why any rate relief for borrowers is now well into next year | The Business | ABC NEWS,"A Melbourne Cup rate cut from the Reserve Bank was a non-starter. After three cuts this year, the RBA board kept the cash rate on hold at 3.6 per cent with its Governor Michele Bullock citing hotter-than-expected inflation. The RBA now says it's on the fence when it comes to its next interest rate move.  But some economists say any rate relief for borrowers won't happen until at least the middle of 2026. Economist Chris Richardson says ""the last mile in the fight against inflation is pretty tough"" for most central banks. Cost of living pressures are being driven by surging electricity prices and housing, with property prices rising at the fastest pace in more than two years. For borrowers, Canstar's Sally Tindall says there's been a surge in refinancing -- with roughly a thousand borrowers switching lenders each day. Ms Tindall says the average owner occupier's variable is around 5.5 per cent, but a competitive rate would be below 5.25 per cent. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-11-04T08:03:36+00:00,Is the government's plan to give free power not as good as it seems? | The Business | ABC NEWS,"From July next year, households will have access to at least three free hours of power as long as they take up the default market offer and have a smart meter. The government's newly announced Solar Sharer Scheme will force retailers to make it available to consumers in NSW, South East Queensland, and South Australia. The aim is to soak up the nation's abundant daytime solar power, stabilising the grid and lowering power prices in peak periods. The founder of SolarQuotes, now owned by Origin Energy, Finn Peacock says its a great headline, but the devil is in the detail. "" I think its a good idea to reduce the cost of electricity during the day, to encourage more electricity during the day, but I think forcing retailers to offer it for free for three hours is only likely to push up other costs for consumers."" Power retailers say they've been blindsided and shocked by the scheme that puts smaller operators under pressure. Chief Executive Officer at the Australian Energy Council says ""Generally the charge that comes from the companies that operate the poles are wires still exists for that middle of the day but retailers are effectively covering that cost in the middle of the day."" she says "" For smaller retailers in particular we do need to think carefully about whether they can actually cover those costs.

Survivors who escaped to Tawila say fighters rounded up civilians, separated men from women and shot detainees after hurling racial slurs, with satellite analysis suggesting systematic ethnic-based killings.  Reuters and UN-verified videos show RSF fighters shooting captives and bodies scattered across streets, despite RSF denials and claims of “media exaggeration”.  Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab says violence mirrors early stages of the Rwandan genocide, describing “door-to-door clearance operations” targeting non-Arab communities.  International concern is growing amid accusations the UAE armed RSF forces, allegations it denies, as aid agencies warn tens of thousands remain trapped and unaccounted for.

2025-10-30T02:23:57+00:00,New AFP taskforce to target men 'hunting' young girls for violent acts | ABC NEWS,"The Australian Federal Police have been working with Microsoft to develop AI tools to interpret Gen Z and Alpha slang to quickly identify children at risk of sadistic online exploitation.  New AFP Commissioner Krissy Barrett used her first speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday to announce the creation of Taskforce Pompilid, which will use the technology amongst a raft of measures to crack down on decentralised online crime networks.    The AFP is warning that young girls are being ""hunted, stalked and drawn-in"" by men using online networks to coerce them into carrying out serious acts of violence on themselves, their siblings or pets, in a ""twisted type of gamification"".  The Commissioner also offered practical steps to keep children out of harm's way.  ""Let kids know they have the right to feel safe online and, if something feels uncomfortable, they can leave a chat at any time and tell a safe adult.   You can encourage safe conversations by talking regularly about online activities and apps, encouraging critical thinking, and reassuring kids that they won't be punished for coming forward if they think they have done something wrong.   Also, you can look out for warning signs that include self-harm, changes in eating or sleeping habits, sudden withdrawal from friends, families or activities, use of extreme behaviour, extreme language or symbols, and rejection of previously held morals.   Importantly, there are really practical and easy resources available, including how to make a report about child exploitation, at the AFP-led Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation website. That's www.acce.gov.au"". she said.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-10-29T20:00:51+00:00,"No rate cut until mid-2026, says NAB chief economist | The Business | ABC NEWS","Inflation has surged in the September quarter with consumer prices rising at an annual pace of 3.2 per cent, up from 2.1 per cent in the June quarter. The ""trimmed mean"" for the September quarter, which strips out the most volatile price moves up and down, came in at 1 per cent. The headline number was 1.3 per cent. On an annual basis, the trimmed mean lifted to the top of the RBA's target band at 3 per cent. It was much hotter than the RBA and market economists were expecting, squashing hopes of a rate cut next week. In fact, NAB chief economist Sally Auld told The Business NAB isn't expecting another rate cut until mid-2026. ""No rate cuts for the rest of this year, likely no rate cuts in the first quarter of next year, but we do have one more rate cut in our profile but not until May of 2026,"" She said. ""I think really the message from today's numbers is that it is going to require a little bit of patience on the part of mortgage holders just to give the Reserve Bank a good chance to get comfortable and a bit more confident in terms of some of the underlying drivers of inflation.""  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-29/september-quarter-inflation-kills-interest-rate-cut/105946770  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-10-28T00:45:26+00:00,King Charles heckled over brother Prince Andrew | ABC NEWS,"King Charles was heckled by a protester on Monday over his brother Prince Andrew's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The king was greeting royal fans during a cathedral visit in Britain.  ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?,"" the man could be heard shouting outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England, close to Birmingham.  Although Prince Andrew, 65, said this month that he would give up using his title of Duke of York after years of scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein, questions about him — and what the royals knew of events — have intensified since.  The contents of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, have triggered renewed backlash over the issue this month.  Andrew has always denied Giuffre's account. In 2022, he made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.  British police are looking into media reports that in 2011 Andrew had asked one of his police officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre.  The protester could also be heard saying: ""Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? ... Should the MPs (members of parliament) be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?""  The monarch ignored the protester and carried on engaging with other members of the public.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

The constitution's 22nd amendment prevents anyone from being elected to the office of president more than twice. However, this hasn't stopped rampant speculation that Trump will mount a move to either remain in office in 2028, or find a legal workaround to permit a third tilt at the presidency.  Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked point-blank if he would rule out a third run. ""Am I ruling it out? You tell me,"" he responded. Trump did, however, address one popularly held theory that he could run as Vice President behind JD Vance, with Vance immediately stepping down after winning an election. Despite that too being constitutionally forbidden, Trump said he would not do it because ""it's too cute.""
