Survivors who escaped to Tawila say fighters rounded up civilians, separated men from women and shot detainees after hurling racial slurs, with satellite analysis suggesting systematic ethnic-based killings.  Reuters and UN-verified videos show RSF fighters shooting captives and bodies scattered across streets, despite RSF denials and claims of “media exaggeration”.  Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab says violence mirrors early stages of the Rwandan genocide, describing “door-to-door clearance operations” targeting non-Arab communities.  International concern is growing amid accusations the UAE armed RSF forces, allegations it denies, as aid agencies warn tens of thousands remain trapped and unaccounted for.

2025-10-30T02:23:57+00:00,New AFP taskforce to target men 'hunting' young girls for violent acts | ABC NEWS,"The Australian Federal Police have been working with Microsoft to develop AI tools to interpret Gen Z and Alpha slang to quickly identify children at risk of sadistic online exploitation.  New AFP Commissioner Krissy Barrett used her first speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday to announce the creation of Taskforce Pompilid, which will use the technology amongst a raft of measures to crack down on decentralised online crime networks.    The AFP is warning that young girls are being ""hunted, stalked and drawn-in"" by men using online networks to coerce them into carrying out serious acts of violence on themselves, their siblings or pets, in a ""twisted type of gamification"".  The Commissioner also offered practical steps to keep children out of harm's way.  ""Let kids know they have the right to feel safe online and, if something feels uncomfortable, they can leave a chat at any time and tell a safe adult.   You can encourage safe conversations by talking regularly about online activities and apps, encouraging critical thinking, and reassuring kids that they won't be punished for coming forward if they think they have done something wrong.   Also, you can look out for warning signs that include self-harm, changes in eating or sleeping habits, sudden withdrawal from friends, families or activities, use of extreme behaviour, extreme language or symbols, and rejection of previously held morals.   Importantly, there are really practical and easy resources available, including how to make a report about child exploitation, at the AFP-led Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation website. That's www.acce.gov.au"". she said.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-10-29T20:00:51+00:00,"No rate cut until mid-2026, says NAB chief economist | The Business | ABC NEWS","Inflation has surged in the September quarter with consumer prices rising at an annual pace of 3.2 per cent, up from 2.1 per cent in the June quarter. The ""trimmed mean"" for the September quarter, which strips out the most volatile price moves up and down, came in at 1 per cent. The headline number was 1.3 per cent. On an annual basis, the trimmed mean lifted to the top of the RBA's target band at 3 per cent. It was much hotter than the RBA and market economists were expecting, squashing hopes of a rate cut next week. In fact, NAB chief economist Sally Auld told The Business NAB isn't expecting another rate cut until mid-2026. ""No rate cuts for the rest of this year, likely no rate cuts in the first quarter of next year, but we do have one more rate cut in our profile but not until May of 2026,"" She said. ""I think really the message from today's numbers is that it is going to require a little bit of patience on the part of mortgage holders just to give the Reserve Bank a good chance to get comfortable and a bit more confident in terms of some of the underlying drivers of inflation.""  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-29/september-quarter-inflation-kills-interest-rate-cut/105946770  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-10-28T00:45:26+00:00,King Charles heckled over brother Prince Andrew | ABC NEWS,"King Charles was heckled by a protester on Monday over his brother Prince Andrew's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The king was greeting royal fans during a cathedral visit in Britain.  ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?,"" the man could be heard shouting outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England, close to Birmingham.  Although Prince Andrew, 65, said this month that he would give up using his title of Duke of York after years of scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein, questions about him — and what the royals knew of events — have intensified since.  The contents of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, have triggered renewed backlash over the issue this month.  Andrew has always denied Giuffre's account. In 2022, he made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.  British police are looking into media reports that in 2011 Andrew had asked one of his police officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre.  The protester could also be heard saying: ""Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? ... Should the MPs (members of parliament) be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?""  The monarch ignored the protester and carried on engaging with other members of the public.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

The constitution's 22nd amendment prevents anyone from being elected to the office of president more than twice. However, this hasn't stopped rampant speculation that Trump will mount a move to either remain in office in 2028, or find a legal workaround to permit a third tilt at the presidency.  Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked point-blank if he would rule out a third run. ""Am I ruling it out? You tell me,"" he responded. Trump did, however, address one popularly held theory that he could run as Vice President behind JD Vance, with Vance immediately stepping down after winning an election. Despite that too being constitutionally forbidden, Trump said he would not do it because ""it's too cute.""
