The company's new chief executive, Tania Archibald says BlueScope is dealing with the third straight year of bottom of cycle spreads. ""I think it's really driven by the property market in China"", she says. ""The relatively lower levels of demand that we're seeing in China at the moment, that will eventually recover. But how it's manifesting of course is these large volumes of steel exports that are coming out of China, they're having a dampening effect on margins and prices.""  Tania Archibald confirmed BlueScope remains interested in the Whyalla Steelworks' potential for DRI or direct reduced iron technology to produce ""green iron"". BlueScope leads an international consortium investigating the future viability of a DRI project at Whyalla.  BlueScope released its half-year earnings results on Monday, which showed net profit after tax more than doubled to around $391million.  #ABCBusiness  Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
