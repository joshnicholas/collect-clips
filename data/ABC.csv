2025-11-11T02:15:04+00:00,Scientists found a giant spider city in a cave | ABC NEWS,"If the words 'arachnid supercity' set your pulse racing ... maybe sit this one out. In Sulfur Cave, straddling the Greek–Albanian border, lies what could be the largest spider web ever found, a recent study has revealed. After first discovering the colonial spider community in 2022, researchers now estimate the more than 100-square-metre web is home to around 110,000 spiders. Two different species inhabit the web, each genetically distinct from their relatives on the surface.  The researchers also say it's the first time these usually solitary spiders have been seen forming colonies, a finding the team describes as ""extraordinary."" It's thought the reason for the Sulfur Cave's popularity with spiders is the huge number of midges that also dwell in its depths, offering a plentiful food source for the arachnids.
