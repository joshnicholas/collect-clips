2026-02-05T08:00:35+00:00,Falling US dollar and global uncertainty spark modern day gold rush | The Business | ABC NEWS,"The demise of American exceptionalism, a troubled Chinese economy and a falling US dollar have created fear, confusion and a flight to safety for investors in the form of a modern day gold rush. Australia's biggest mining companies and the Commonwealth Bank are expected to produce strong earnings this reporting season. ""About six months ago, we were expecting that for the financial year 2026 earnings for the overall ASX 200 would grow only by about 3 per cent. Now, six months later, the expectations for that full year 2026 earnings growth sits above 10 per cent."" UBS equity strategist Richard Schellbach said. ""We're seeing copper and gold near record highs and that is going to have a really big boost to these companies' margins,"" fund manager Roger Montgomery said. But analysts say uncertainty around data centre investment, geo-politics and rising interest rates put dark clouds over the rest of the financial year. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
