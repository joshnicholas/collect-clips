2025-12-01T19:00:00+00:00,Are NIMBYs and local councils a roadblock to solving Australia's housing crisis? | The Business,"The public policy think tank, Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), believes Australia could increase its current housing stock by nine per cent, or a million homes, if just one in four standalone homes in the five biggest cities are developed into dual occupancies. It's calling on governments to do more to increase so called ""gentle density"" in the middle rings of Australia's biggest cities, by allowing more terrace housing, townhouses, low-rise apartments and dual occupancy. CEDA chief economist Cassandra Winzar joined The Business to discuss the first of CEDA's five new reports on housing.  She says some of the roadblocks in achieving higher density housing comes from local governments and so-called NIMBYs (Not In My Back Yard) local residents. She says right now local councils don't have an incentive to increase zoning, but one solution could be a ""carrot and stick"" approach where financial incentives are given to councils that make inroads to increase housing supply. She says when local governments don't meet zoning or supply requirements, the state or federal government should take over.  Cassandra Winzar says Australia can't keep building further and further out to keep up with growing demand and population growth, as it will put a lot of pressure on infrastructure. ""We'll need new transport systems and that leads to long commutes and difficulties accessing services,"" she says. Ms Winzar says Australia is one of the least dense countries in the world. Even Sydney, Australia's highest density city, ranks at around 800th globally. She says Australians may need to reimagine what the average family home, aka the Australian dream, actually looks like, if they want to see a solution to the housing crisis. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
