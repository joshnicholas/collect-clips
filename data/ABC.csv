2025-10-27T23:15:03+00:00,Donald Trump says he 'would love' third term | ABC NEWS,"US President Donald Trump ruled out running for the vice presidency in the 2028 election, an approach some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican president to serve an additional term in office. The remarks were Trump's latest on the subject, which he has teased in public remarks and with ""Trump 2028"" hats he hands out at the White House. No one may be elected to the US presidency a third time, according to the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. Some have suggested that one way around this prohibition would be for Trump to stand as vice president, while another candidate stood for president and resigned, letting Trump again assume the presidency. Opponents have disputed whether this would be legal. Referring to Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump also said they were ""great people"" who could run for the office.

2025-10-28T00:45:26+00:00,King Charles heckled over brother Prince Andrew | ABC NEWS,"King Charles was heckled by a protester on Monday over his brother Prince Andrew's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The king was greeting royal fans during a cathedral visit in Britain.  ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?,"" the man could be heard shouting outside Lichfield Cathedral in northwest England, close to Birmingham.  Although Prince Andrew, 65, said this month that he would give up using his title of Duke of York after years of scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein, questions about him — and what the royals knew of events — have intensified since.  The contents of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, have triggered renewed backlash over the issue this month.  Andrew has always denied Giuffre's account. In 2022, he made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.  British police are looking into media reports that in 2011 Andrew had asked one of his police officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre.  The protester could also be heard saying: ""Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew? ... Should the MPs (members of parliament) be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?""  The monarch ignored the protester and carried on engaging with other members of the public.  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
