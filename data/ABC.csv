2026-01-23T00:30:28+00:00,South Korea's world-first legal framework to regulate AI | ABC NEWS,"South Korea has implemented what it claims is the world's first comprehensive set of laws regulating artificial intelligence (AI). The country aims to become one of the top three AI powerhouses globally. The new laws require tech companies to ensure human oversight, risk management, and auditing for ""high-impact"" AI systems. Olivia Shen, the director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the United States Studies Centre, explains that these laws are designed to support domestic AI development. This year alone, South Korea is investing 10 trillion Korean won (AUD$10 billion) in AI. In contrast, Australia's National AI plan, released late last year, ruled out any immediate comprehensive regulations, opting instead to manage AI through existing laws.
