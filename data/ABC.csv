2026-02-06T07:01:18+00:00,Panic grips investors caught up in the biggest ASX sell-off since Liberation Day,"The Australian share market fell by more than two per cent in the worst one day fall since April 2025 when Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs sparked fears of global trade barriers rocked markets. Almost $70 billion was wiped from the ASX on Friday. Panic selling gripped most markets with precious metals falling, and bitcoin wiping out its 2025 Trump rally, back down to 2024 levels. The tech sector slid as AI spending and software redundancy fears sparked a sell-off. Director at NAB Trade Gemma Dale says ""in some cases a lot of things have run very hard. It's worth remembering that during 'Liberation Day' there was a very aggressive sell-off and just an extraordinary run and a whole serious of things have run very hard and they don't tend to run very hard together, so when we've seen physical metals, gold and silver run together, that's fine. But you don't anticipate that happening at the same time as the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500. So there's just been this incredible convergence things performing incredibly well after what was pretty catastrophic economic news, even though a lot of it was resolved, or settled in to vague uncertainty, now perhaps markets feel its time to take a bit off the table."" For the week, the ASX finished down 1.8 per cent.
