2026-02-23T06:44:46+00:00,Trump could go harder on tariffs warns Rabobank's Michael Every | The Business,"Australia's trade minister Don Farrell says the government will argue against the US president's decision to raise tariffs on Australian imports from 10 to 15 per cent. The tariff hike will come into force on Tuesday (Australian time) after the US Supreme Court struck down his 'Liberation Day' tariffs.  Rabobank's global strategist, Michael Every says tariffs won't go away because Donald Trump has other laws he can invoke ""and even if one of them gets shut down over the next six months, he has others after that,"" he tells The Business. Mr Every says the message coming from the White House is ""you push back, you just get more chaos until you accept that this is the way things are going to be."" He says for Australia, that means there will likely be a whole round of renegotiation all over again.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2026-02-23T07:26:41+00:00,How homeowners are reducing their insurance premiums | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Home insurance premiums have increased on average by 51 per cent in just five years, according to data analytics firm Finity. Homes at risk of natural disasters have the biggest premiums.  Residents in Brisbane's west pay the most, averaging $8,396 a year, while homeowners in Darwin City and Sydney's outer west and Blue Mountains region average $5,410 and $5,350, respectively.    In the capital cities, Finity data shows that Darwin residents pay the most for home insurance, followed by Sydney and Brisbane. Finity principal Stephen Lau said an increase in disasters caused by climate change and an increase in building costs had been the main drivers for insurance price hikes.  The Resilience Building Council is working with homeowners to create safer builds, which could reduce risk ratings and lower insurance costs.  Adelaide Miller talks to one couple, who managed to reduce their premium by $500.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-23/home-insurance-premiums-increase-51-per-cent-in-five-years/106308824  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
