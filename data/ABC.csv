2026-02-18T08:00:56+00:00,Why Australians are falling behind | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Australians' pay rises are not keeping pace with the rising cost of living. New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has confirmed workers have been going backwards.  The Wage Price Index (WPI) for the 12 months to December 2025 rose 3.4 per cent — lower than inflation for the same period. Because wages are not rising faster than inflation it means ""real wages"" are falling. Private sector pay went up 3.4 per cent, while public sector workers saw their wages increase by 4 per cent.  Melbourne sheet manufacturer Catten Industries says the pressures of wages and input costs to manufacture have made it very difficult for the business to be competitive. ""It puts pressure on our costs because obviously people want more money to be able to make ends meet at the end of the day,"" he says. ""All of my family work in the business as well, but included in that we've got 37 other families that all rely on our business to be successful."" #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-18/wage-price-index-lags-inflation-real-wages-of-workers/106356432  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2026-02-18T08:30:26+00:00,Health insurance loopholes leave customers thousands out of pocket | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Private health insurance premiums are set to rise by more than four percent, the largest rise since 2017. The increases this year are supposed to cover rising private hospital costs as some struggle to stay afloat.  But for some patients, their policies are covering less each year, especially when it comes to accidents and joint replacements.  Some 360,000 people have downgraded their policies from gold since 2020. Brett Heffernan from the Australian Private Hospitals Association says customers choosing to downgrade had become a regular occurrence during the cost-of-living crisis, but it also suited insurers because silver policies were still lucrative, but with far more exclusions.  PHA chief executive Rachel David said it was up to consumers to be aware of policy exclusions and read their disclosure statements closely.  ""There are probably ways in which the health funds can do better in explaining what accident cover actually entails, but any product that you buy that's less than top hospital cover will have exclusions,"" she said. Accident inclusion insurance typically gives patients access to gold-level benefits, like joint replacements, in the case of an accident.   #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-18/private-health-patients-discover-exclusions-downgrade-policy/106325324  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
