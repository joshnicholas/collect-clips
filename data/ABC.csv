On a statutory basis, profit fell 9 per cent to $16.3 million and revenue rose 5 per cent. Macquarie Technology CEO David Tudehope says ""It's so important we embrace the AI change. I've been in industry a long time. In my mind this is as big as the internet in 1998. This will change everyone's lives."" he said. This week, logistics software company WiseTech Global announced its cutting 2,000 roles as a result of AI, while the owner of Afterpay, Block in the US, is cutting its workforce by 4,000 jobs. On job losses, Mr Tudehope is reasonably optimistic ""I don't think what you're seeing in the headlines over the last week is what I'm seeing corporate Australia"" he said. There was a raft of corporate results this week. Coles share price went down, down just like its campaign slogan after it announced a fall in half year profit and Qantas posted a flat result as Vanessa Hudson continued to refresh the airline.
