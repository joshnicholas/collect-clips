2025-11-06T07:45:03+00:00,"Building up, not out is key to solving housing supply crisis, says Grattan Institute | The Business","Australia needs around 250,000 new homes to be built a year over the next four years to reach the 1.2 million home government target. 176,000 homes were built in the first year of the National Housing Accord. Builders and experts agree building out isn't enough. Now the prominent think-tank The Grattan Institute says building up is part of the solution. Housing and economic security programme director at the Grattan Institute, Brendan Coates says Australian cities are some of the least dense of their size in the world. ""We haven't allowed enough housing in those areas where Australians most want to live in those inner and middle ring suburbs of our capital cities,"" he says. Grattan wants a green light for three story dwellings on every residential block, adding 67,000 new homes a year and saving $100,000 a house. However the building industry says there's a drastic short fall of skilled labour. Supervisor at McDonald Jones Homes, Brian Skinner says ""Skilled labour is still the number one issue that the building industry, not only in New South Wales but across Australia, needs to tackle."" Land prices have also been flagged as a barrier to building more homes. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
