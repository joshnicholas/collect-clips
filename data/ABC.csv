2026-02-20T07:05:15+00:00,"Big one day sell-offs blamed on algorithms and short-term trading, says Morningstar","During reporting season, numerous stocks like AMP, Temple and Webster, Zip and Pro Medicus have their seen stock prices plunge by around 30 per cent in one day as investors react to the corporate reports in the current half-year earnings season. In many cases though, Morningstar's equity market strategist Lochlan Halloway says, the result alone doesn't justify the steep price fall, and the fall may instead be due to changing market dynamics and the way equities are traded. Mr Halloway points to short term capital flooding the market and algorithmic trades. He says, ""the fastest reaction is not the most considered on, nor is it necessarily right."" He says broadly company reports have been positive and earnings are picking up, with the resources sector doing well. Alicia Barry presents this segment and looks at earnings season so far as well as how a strong jobs market may heap pressure on the RBA to raise interest rates again in 2026.  #ABCBusiness  Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
