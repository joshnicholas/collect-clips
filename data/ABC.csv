2025-12-03T10:01:04+00:00,"A declining birth rate will be costly in the long run, says Peter Costello | The Business | ABC NEWS","If you recognise the phrase ""one for mum, one for dad, one for the country"", you'll also remember when Australia had a baby bonus, which saw new parents receive a lump sum payment of $3,000. It was widely credited for a sustained increase in births in the following years. Those now-famous words came from then treasurer Peter Costello, encouraging Australians to go back to the bedroom to push up the fertility rate. The baby bonus ended in 2014. Today, Australia's fertility rate is at a record low - under 1.5 births per woman - below the 2.1 needed for population replacement. Peter Costello speaks to The Business to explain what Australia's declining birth rate will mean in decades to come and why he wants the government to address the declining birth rate.   He says lower birth rates indicate a decreased confidence in the future, saying people don't want to have children if they don't think the future will be better than what it is now. He was appearing at an event by E61 to discuss the declining birth rate. A recent report by the research institute says the decline in total fertility rates comes down to three factors - later parenthood, having fewer children, and rising childlessness rates. The report says ""growing influences likely point to financial pressures increasing in importance, as well as the sharper work-family tradeoff that women relative to men often must manage. The availability of grandmothers offering informal childcare support also has a direct impact on their daughter's fertility decisions."" Mr Costello says housing affordability is another factor in fertility decisions. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
