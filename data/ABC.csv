2026-02-09T08:00:56+00:00,Fears of a Japan debt crisis dismissed as share markets soar | The Business | ABC NEWS,"The promise of tax cuts and additional cost of living measures which propelled Japan's prime minister to a historic landslide victory have seen the Japanese share market soar. Its economy - the fifth largest in the world - is consequential for the global economy and markets.  Blackrock's head of active equity for Japan, Yue Bamba joined The Business from Tokyo. He says the weekend result creates some stability in the world's political system. He says fears of a Japanese debt crisis is unwarranted, because even though the country's debt-to-GDP is elevated, it's decreasing.  He says he believes Sanae Takaichi and her government will be 'sensible' in running the economy.   Bond and FX markets have reacted positively, as well as the Yen 'holding up remarkably well', he said.  ""The market is reacting in such a way, especially the long end of the interest rate curve, because that (instability) in the long end of the GDP curve could have had ripple effects to the rest of the world,"" he says.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2026-02-09T09:15:04+00:00,Why young workers could get a pay boost | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Hardworking young people are closely watching a key wage case that could boost their pay, while businesses warn it could cause a collapse in employment. ""Junior pay rates"" apply to people below the age of 21 in agreements covering sectors that employ a lot of young people in retail, fast food and pharmacy.  Those discounts mean 18-year-olds are paid 70 per cent of the award rate, 80 per cent for 19-year-olds and 90 per cent for 20-year-olds.  The Fair Work Commission has finished hearings but has not announced when it will hand down its decision. Advocates argue that at 17 you can enlist in the armed forces, and at 18 you are legally entitled to vote, drive, smoke and drink alcohol.  Ai Group's Innes Willox says any big shift that increases staff costs will have dire consequences for young people. ""Young people won't be hired for jobs, and that will be to the detriment of them,"" he said.  Sally McManus, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions compared the cheaper rates paid to juniors — and employers' fears of change — to the situation more than 50 years ago, when paying women less for doing the same work as men was first outlawed.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-09/millions-of-young-people-could-get-massive-pay-boost-in-totemic/106101186  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
