2026-02-25T07:30:29+00:00,Ian Verrender fact checks Donald Trump's claims on the economy and tariffs | The Business | ABC NEWS,"During the longest State of the Union address on record, US President Donald Trump boasted that the stock market is booming, inflation is coming down, wages are heading up, and America is in a golden age.  But is the American economy as strong as Donald trump says it is?   ABC's chief business correspondent Ian Verrender sits down with Kirsten Aiken to discuss the US President's claims about the economy.  Ian Verrender says the American economy has been performing quite well for some time, but largely because of the amount of investment in artificial intelligence and data centres.  ""Of course, the whole boom in artificial investment and data centers has driven Wall Street for quite some time. That does seem to be coming to an end, though.  There's a lot of investors who are really quite lacking confidence in the future,"" he tells The Business.  He says in the past six months or so, around about $75 billion worth of US investors has been money flowing out of the country, and about $25 billion of that was since the start of this year. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
