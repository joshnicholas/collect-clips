The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 per cent in October, undercutting RBA and market forecasts. While the official jobless rate may be relatively low, it seems to be getting harder for those hitting the pavement in search of work. More than 40,000 jobs were added with many of them seasonal casuals.  Highly skilled job seeker Simon Torok says he's applied for more than 300 jobs in the last six months with just seven interviews.  Senior economist for online jobs site Seek says he's seeing record high numbers of applications. The strong jobs numbers puts the Reserve Bank under pressure as borrowers clamour for rate relief. #ABCBusiness  Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

Opposition Leader Susan Ley says the party can deliver lower power prices and reduced emissions without the target. The announcement has been met with silence and in some cases, open dismay.

""But now I think there would be a great degree of nervousness about that"". Orica CEO Sanjeev Gandhi says the change is disruptive and ""we do not want to end up decimating manufacturing in Australia."" #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
