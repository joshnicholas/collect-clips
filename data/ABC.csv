2025-11-04T08:03:36+00:00,Is the government's plan to give free power not as good as it seems? | The Business | ABC NEWS,"From July next year, households will have access to at least three free hours of power as long as they take up the default market offer and have a smart meter. The government's newly announced Solar Sharer Scheme will force retailers to make it available to consumers in NSW, South East Queensland, and South Australia. The aim is to soak up the nation's abundant daytime solar power, stabilising the grid and lowering power prices in peak periods. The founder of SolarQuotes, now owned by Origin Energy, Finn Peacock says its a great headline, but the devil is in the detail. "" I think its a good idea to reduce the cost of electricity during the day, to encourage more electricity during the day, but I think forcing retailers to offer it for free for three hours is only likely to push up other costs for consumers."" Power retailers say they've been blindsided and shocked by the scheme that puts smaller operators under pressure. Chief Executive Officer at the Australian Energy Council says ""Generally the charge that comes from the companies that operate the poles are wires still exists for that middle of the day but retailers are effectively covering that cost in the middle of the day."" she says "" For smaller retailers in particular we do need to think carefully about whether they can actually cover those costs.

2025-11-04T08:30:30+00:00,Why any rate relief for borrowers is now well into next year | The Business | ABC NEWS,"A Melbourne Cup rate cut from the Reserve Bank was a non-starter. After three cuts this year, the RBA board kept the cash rate on hold at 3.6 per cent with its Governor Michele Bullock citing hotter-than-expected inflation. The RBA now says it's on the fence when it comes to its next interest rate move.  But some economists say any rate relief for borrowers won't happen until at least the middle of 2026. Economist Chris Richardson says ""the last mile in the fight against inflation is pretty tough"" for most central banks. Cost of living pressures are being driven by surging electricity prices and housing, with property prices rising at the fastest pace in more than two years. For borrowers, Canstar's Sally Tindall says there's been a surge in refinancing -- with roughly a thousand borrowers switching lenders each day. Ms Tindall says the average owner occupier's variable is around 5.5 per cent, but a competitive rate would be below 5.25 per cent. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
