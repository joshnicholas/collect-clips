The 98-metre New Glenn blasted into the sky from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Thursday afternoon, local time, sending twin Mars orbiters on a journey to the Red Planet.  The launch followed several days of delays due to cloudy skies and a geomagnetic storm.  The space venture of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos achieved a key engineering objective when its reusable first-stage booster separated from the rocket's upper stage minutes after launch and flew back to Earth.  The New Glenn is carrying two satellites on their way to Mars in the company's first NASA-scale science mission.  The dual spacecraft, dubbed Blue and Gold, are due to reach Mars in 2027.
