Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigators raided homes and businesses across Darwin on Friday after receiving a tip-off from the Department of Defence about the alleged crime. The AFP alleges a 48-year-old Commonwealth Defence employee, his 40-year-old wife, and a 41-year-old male director of a local construction firm had conspired to channel nearly $71 million of Defence building contracts to their own company. During the raids, investigators seized $30,000 in cash, documents, electronic devices, jewellery and a small quantity of illicit drugs, which the AFP suspects is cocaine. In a statement, the AFP alleged that the group ""were involved in a conspiracy to influence the awarding of tenders to their company, with the intention of dishonestly gaining a benefit from the Commonwealth, namely the Department of Defence"".
