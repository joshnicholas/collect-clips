2025-12-01T08:00:03+00:00,House prices continue to climb but rates outlook removes some heat | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Housing prices continue to climb across the country but the pace of growth is easing as the Sydney and Melbourne markets lag the mid-sized capital cities.  Perth led the monthly gains, followed by Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin, Hobart, the regions, Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne.    Cotality's national Home Value Index rose 1 per cent in November and 7.5 per cent for the year.  The skew towards the mid-sized capitals is especially evident in Perth, where listings are holding more than 40 per cent below average.  In comparison, Sydney had a smaller shortfall in supply compared to demand, as listings are tracking just 2.2 per cent below the five-year average, compared to 16 per cent below average listings across the capital cities.  Cotality head of research Eliza Owen told The Business the slight easing in home value growth in November was not a huge surprise, given the shifting outlook for rates.  She said interest rate cuts had been keeping the market momentum alive through 2025. Now the outlook has changed, she thinks that's affecting buyer decision-making.   Another factor at play in the housing market heading into the new year will be recently announced lending limits.  The banking regulator APRA said it would restrict high debt-to-income (DTI) ratio loans to 20 per cent of a bank's new lending.  Ms Owen said it was a preventive measure that would have limited impact on prices because the majority of new mortgages are below this threshold.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-01/home-price-streak-continues-but-rates-outlook-takes-out-heat/106083314  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
