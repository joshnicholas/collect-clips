2025-12-08T06:15:07+00:00,Harnessing the people power of co-ops to stave off privatisation | The Business | ABC NEWS,"A goldrush-era pub has been acquired by hundreds of Castlemaine locals who came together to buy it — without going to a bank.  The heritage building is known as the Hub and it houses small businesses and not-for-profits, a cafe and a community garden.The main concern from locals was that private buyers might swoop in and see the building through the lens of financial gain, adding to what some perceive as a ""broken"" local property market. Warwick Smith, an economist, helped hatch the plan to buy the double-titled property through the Castlemaine Community Investment Co-operative.    Co-operatives are member-owned organisations, operating for the benefit of those who sign up.  Members then own and control the enterprise, typically to operate an asset or run a business.  Those who buy into a co-op are direct owners, and profits or benefits go back to them. More communities nationally are turning to this economic model — buying everything from pubs to aged care centres — in what one advocate describes as a simmering national movement. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here:  https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-08/castlemaine-cooperative-privatisation-economic-democracy/106103270  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-12-08T07:07:01+00:00,Are Wall Street titans' fears of a 2026 tech wreck justified? | The Business | ABC NEWS,"The boom in artificial intelligence has driven market gains for another year, but it's also given rise to fears of a forming bubble. Several Wall Street titans have expressed concerns, including JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, who recently said he was ""worried"" about a big correction. Since the introduction of AI assistant ChatGPT three years ago, the tech heavy NASDAQ has risen by more than 100 per cent. Co-founder of tech driven equities fund Minotaur Capital, Armina Rosenberg says she expects there's likely to be a 10-15 per cent market correction next year. However, she says valuations in the tech and AI sector now are stretched, but they're not as high as they were during the dot-com bubble of the 90s. She says the Magnificent 7 stocks have a much lower price-to-earnings ratio compared to the top seven stocks of 2000.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
