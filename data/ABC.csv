2025-11-27T08:28:11+00:00,Banking regulator to cap home loans amid housing boom | The Business | ABC NEWS,"The banking regulator will impose new restrictions on home loans from early next year to limit the number of ""high-risk"" large loans being issued to customers. APRA is ordering the institutions under its supervision to limit high debt-to-income loans to 20 per cent of all new loans approved. The regulator says the 20 per cent cap will apply separately to investor and owner-occupier loans, to avoid the risk of investors ""crowding out"" owner-occupier buyers. A high debt-to-income loan is defined as one where the total amount borrowed is more than six times the borrower's annual household income. The new cap on high debt-to-income loans takes effect on February 1. Alicia Barry spoke with APRA chair, John Lonsdale, in his first TV interview. He says; ""we're particularly targeting high debt to income lending, if we're successful at that, we'd expect good quality lending to keep happening through the economy and I think that's good for borrowers of all sorts.""  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-27/banking-regulator-apra-imposes-home-loan-caps/106058604  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
