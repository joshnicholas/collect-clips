2026-02-19T08:45:06+00:00,AI job loss fears loom despite unemployment remaining steady | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Australia's unemployment rate remained at 4.1 per cent in January, the same as in December, in seasonally adjusted terms. The participation rate remained unchanged. The data reveals workers landed tens of thousands of full-time jobs, putting pressure on the Reserve Bank to deliver a follow-up interest rate hike. It comes as the AI revolution threatens to change work as we know it.  IT solutions architect Ron Skruzny is one of those impacted by AI. He's spent a lifetime designing back-end systems for websites -- something artificial intelligence is now being trained to do -- at lower cost than hiring Ron.  Telstra recently announced it was looking to let go more than 600 staff as it accelerates the rollout of AI. CEO Vicky Brady says embracing AI is necessary ""to put us in a position to be competitive"" but no jobs have been lost as a consequence of the new technology. #ABCBusiness  Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
