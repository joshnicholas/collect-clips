Kristy DiGiacomo, a senior lecturer in production, animal nutrition and physiology at the University of Melbourne, said the goat's behaviour was all about scarce resources.   ""Goats will headbutt for various reasons, including dominance, mating competition, defence, or just for play,"" Dr DiGiacomo said.   She said goats' ""personalities"" can change with the amount of resources available.   ""Some [goats] are more likely to act aggressively when feeding, while others can be passive or avoiders,"" Dr DiGiacomo said.   ""Aggressive behaviours tend to increase when access to feed is limited.""   Mr Martin said the goat destroyed the glass front door of his office and two panels.   While he was yet to speak with his insurer, he estimated the damage bill at $4,000.   ""[The goat] didn't manage to get inside, which was good,"" he said.   ""Would have made a bit of a mess.""
