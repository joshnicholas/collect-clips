Some even claimed donations made by members of the public via charity tins on club bars which had no connection with their poker machine profits. The NT government says requiring community clubs to pay a 10 per cent cash levy like pubs and casinos may make some financially unviable.   Jason Walls has this report for Stateline Northern Territory.   Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
