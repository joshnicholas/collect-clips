2026-01-07T11:15:06+00:00,Australia set to roast through nationwide heatwave | ABC NEWS,"Southern Australia will collectively bake this week through the most intense spell of heat in years as temperatures soar up to 15 degrees Celsius above the mid-summer average.  At its peak, daytime maximums will hit the mid-40s across multiple days in a broad stretch of the country from northern WA to the south-east inland — coming within a few degrees of all-time records.  However, milder coastal regions will also sweat through sweltering temperatures, peaking at 44C in Western Sydney, 44C across northern Adelaide, and 42C in Melbourne.  Exceptionally muggy nights will accompany the hot days to produce oppressive conditions, which, combined with the longevity of the event, has triggered a severe-to-extreme heatwave warning across the majority of SA, Victoria, and NSW.
