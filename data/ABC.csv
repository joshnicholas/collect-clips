2025-11-19T07:45:03+00:00,Why workers could see their real wages go backwards in 2026 | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Wage growth slightly outpaces consumer price inflation in the year to September, which means the average worker has received a small increase in their purchasing power, a point highlighted by the Treasurer Jim Chalmers.  However, the increase was down on the same period last year and an economist says workers can expect real wages to fall again next year. Wage rises were stronger for workers in the public sector, led by pay rises for employees of state and local governments. The data alleviates any pressure on the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates.  William Buck chief economist Besa Deda thinks there's a possibility of one more cut in the second half of 2026.  The ABS published a second set of monthly numbers, estimating the total wages and salaries paid by employers to their staff in September.  Payments totalled $108.8 billion, driven higher by bonuses in the mining, utilities, retail, media and financial services sectors, which are often paid in September, in response to financial year targets.  However, the 5.3 per cent annual growth in total wages and salaries paid to employees was down from the 6.1 per cent rise recorded over the year to September 2024. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-19/abs-wage-price-index-figures-released-september-quarter/106026360  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
