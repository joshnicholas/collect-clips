2025-12-09T07:56:06+00:00,Borrowers brace for higher mortgage repayments | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Homeowners were given a warning from the Reserve Bank that interest hikes could be coming in 2026.  Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock has all but confirmed Australia's cash rate will not drop further as the ""risks to inflation have tilted to the upside"". After keeping rates on hold at 3.6 per cent for the third consecutive meeting, the RBA governor said the central bank will either increase rates, or keep them steady at the board's upcoming meetings in 2026.  Treasurer Jim Chalmers said ""a lot of Australians would have wanted some more rate relief, but they wouldn't have expected it.""  If the cash rate was increased, it's highly likely banks and lenders will pass the hike on to customers, pushing up home loan repayments.  Money markets are now fully pricing in a rate hike by next June with an outside chance of one as early as February.  HSBC's chief economist for Australia and New Zealand, Paul Bloxham, agrees the central bank's next move is up.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-09/rba-interest-rate-decision-december-2025/106120130  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-12-09T08:15:00+00:00,How a 'broken' domestic gas system is contributing to high electricity prices | The Business,"High electricity prices are a major driver of inflation and a huge burden on business. Underpinning this is a shortage of domestic gas. The stakes couldn't be higher for the federal government to pick the right solution with the imminent release of its long awaited review into the gas market. Lead analyst for Australian gas at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), Josh Runciman joined The Business to discuss the situation the Australia's domestic gas market is in now. He says in a word, Australia's east coast gas market is broken. He says there are a couple of factors that have contributed to the situation we have now, which include the cheap reserves that have powered eastern Australia for the last 50 years, are gone effectively.   The reserves in offshore Victoria are now in decline. However, he says the key factor that has led to Australia's gas shortage problem was the start of the LNG export industry. He says, ""ten years ago, Santos started exporting from the Gladstone LNG facility and really ever since then, Santos has effectively been taking gas out of the domestic market to meet their export contracts... So that company effectively made a private decision to build an LNG export facility that was larger than they had reserves for, and we've been paying for it ever since."" #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
