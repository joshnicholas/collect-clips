2026-02-10T07:23:50+00:00,Why some medicines aren't listed on the PBS | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Patients are being hit with excessive costs on a range of everyday prescription medicines because of flaws in the way Australia subsidises essential pharmaceuticals. From January, maximum script prices came down to $25 for drugs funded under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. For patients taking private scripts not funded under the scheme, there's no relief. The pharmaceutical industry says sometimes it is not commercially viable for makers to apply for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidy. Australia's PBS was designed to cover the cost of life-saving and disease-prevention medicines and it funds more than 900 medicines across more than 5,000 brands. However, health advocates tell the ABC there are some regularly-purchased drugs that have fallen through Australia's regulatory cracks. These include a range of incontinence medicines, ear drops, eczema creams, inhalers, hormone replacement therapy and painkillers. Medicines Australia's Liz de Somer says the PBS funding system has not kept pace with scientific advances and she thinks ""there are some things that we can do to the system to improve equity of access."" #ABCBusiness  Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE Read more here: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-10/everyday-medicines-not-funded-under-the-pbs/106209526  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
