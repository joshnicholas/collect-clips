2025-12-02T07:45:01+00:00,The online shopping fraud you may not know about | The Business | ABC NEWS,"Shoplifting has long been the bane of small businesses and now the theft has moved online, with frustrated owners telling business reporter Adelaide Miller they have lost thousands of dollars to fraudulent chargebacks — that is, online shoppers disputing legitimate transactions and receiving a refund. The fake refund claims, instigated by shoppers requesting chargebacks through their banks, have been labelled theft. Online fashion store owner Sam Kemp posted a video to Instagram about her experience that went viral. She says she's received hundreds of messages from other small business owners, who have had the same thing happen to them.   Sydney fashion boutique owner Ainslie says she has lost thousands of dollars to chargebacks in recent months, and has had little success convincing banks not to take back the money after purchasers falsely disputed charges on their credit card.  Despite retailers presenting evidence that items were ordered and delivered, some have had transactions cancelled, leaving them without the money or the stock. The frustrated small business owners are now calling for greater protection.   The Australian Banking Association told the ABC it's aware of fraudulent chargeback concerns from small businesses and where possible banks will work with them to resolve  disputes, but it has to fall within the card network provider's timeframes and rules. Mastercard didn't comment but Visa said it had ""introduced rules allowing businesses to use historical purchasing data to fight 'friendly fraud'. This is designed to protect businesses from repeat chargeback abuse."" Payments expert Brad Kelly said one of the reasons small businesses may be unsuccessful in disputing fraudulent chargebacks could be the ""sheer volume"" occurring.  #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE   ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.

2025-12-02T08:45:05+00:00,"The government's AI plan falls well short of keeping Australians safe, says AI expert | The Business","The federal government has laid out its road map to accelerate the development and adoption of AI, accepting demands from business to pause mandatory guardrails, which had been intended to operate under a standalone AI act to protect Australians from potential harms. Co-director of the UTS Human Technology Institute, Professor Nicholas Davis says the government's artificial intelligence plan falls well short when it comes to keeping Australians safe. He says a commitment from the government to protect Australians isn't enough. ""What's important is that the government puts that on the legislative agenda,"" he says. ""I think first off the rank as it were, should be privacy."" He says Australia's data protection and privacy rules are ""woefully out of date"" compared to the rest of the world. He's calling for the government to legislate protections for online safety, privacy, and protections for children. #ABCBusiness Subscribe: http://ab.co/1svxLVE  ABC NEWS provides around the clock coverage of news events as they break in Australia and abroad.
