Delegates instead backed new rules to limit government or third-party influence on voting, a move critics said failed to address concerns about Israel’s inclusion.  Irish broadcaster RTÉ and Spanish broadcaster RTVE said participation was “unconscionable” and “insufficient”, while Dutch and Slovenian broadcasters also withdrew on values grounds.  The BBC and German broadcaster SWR confirmed they will still take part, with Israel officially cleared to compete in next year’s contest in Vienna.  Russia was banned from Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
