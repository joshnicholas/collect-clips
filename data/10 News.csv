2025-11-04T08:06:22+00:00,"Melbourne Cup Day, New Solar Sharer Scheme, New York City Mayoral Race | 10 News+","Australian man Matt Kingston has spoken to 10 News+ about his fearful experience during the UK train stabbing attack which left 11 people injured. It comes amid revelations the suspected stabber may have been on a knife rampage 24 hours before he boarded the London-bound train, and was not stopped by anyone.  There is increasing pressure for Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley to follow the Nationals and ditch their net zero by 2050 target. The party room remains split, with one Ley supporter speaking out and urging the Liberals to remain committed to combatting climate change, in a bid to win back city seats.  Close to a million New Yorkers have already hit the polls on the eve of the city’s mayoral election. A record number of voters are expected to turn out to elect a new man in charge of America’s largest city. The front-runner is 34-year-old Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who could become New York’s first Muslim mayor.  Skywatchers are in for a treat on Wednesday night, with the sky set to be lit up by a rare phenomenon, a full super beaver moon. Dr Matthew Shaw from Swinburne University spoke to 10 News+ about what makes this sight special, and where to get the best views.

2025-11-05T01:11:34+00:00,World Reacts As Former US Vice-President Dick Cheney Dies Aged 84 | 10 News,"Former US vice-president Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful and controversial figures in modern American politics, has died aged 84 from complications of pneumonia and cardiovascular disease.  A key architect of the Iraq War and post-9/11 security agenda, he expanded presidential power, defended interrogation tactics critics labelled torture, and often clashed with senior Bush officials.  Cheney later broke with his party to condemn Donald Trump, warning he posed a threat to US democracy, with Mr Trump yet to comment on his passing.  Reactions have poured in from across the globe, reflecting deep divisions over his legacy and influence.  Praised by George W Bush as a patriot and “among the finest public servants,” he leaves behind a fiercely debated legacy that shaped US foreign policy for decades.
