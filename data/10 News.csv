2025-11-11T08:15:23+00:00,"50 Years Since Whitlam Dismissal, Neo-Nazis Disturb Service, Prince William On Parenting | 10 News+","Fifty years ago, on November 11, 1975, Australia faced its biggest political crisis when the Governor-General Sir John Kerr sensationally sacked the then-Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Current PM Anthony Albanese describes the incident as a “partisan, political ambush” with “no legitimate pretext”. Former PM Paul Keating says the dismissal was “in every respect a coup”. 10 News+ spoke to journalist Leigh Hatcher, who was on the steps of Old Parliament House on that fateful day when the crisis occurred.  The nation stopped at 11am on this Remembrance Day to pay silent tribute to all who have given their lives to serve Australia. Melbourne’s service, at the Shrine of Remembrance, was marred by a disturbing and disrespectful sight. A group of men from a Neo-Nazi organisation held up a White Australia flag at the Shrine, and were promptly moved on by police.  Three Chinese astronauts are extending their stay in space after rogue debris hit their return capsule destined for Earth. The trio were nearing the end of their six months in orbit as part of the Shenzhou-20 mission. While the damage is being investigated, the astronauts are now docked at Tiangong, China’s space station, as experts work out how and when to get them home.  Prince William has opened up about the struggles of being a parent, in a rare and candid interview with Brazilian media. He spoke about the challenges of managing screen time, and his children’s interaction with online, digital spaces, while revealing that his eldest son Prince George still isn’t allowed a mobile phone.
