The White House has also insisted military action is not off the table. Greenland, the world’s largest island, is strategically important because it sits on a pivotal maritime passage, along with Iceland and the UK, that links the Arctic to the North Atlantic. It’s also rich in natural resources including oil, gas and rare earth minerals, which can be used to manufacture everything from electric cars to military equipment.  Cortnee Vine is known as the Matildas’ match-winner and the golden girl who led Australia to a World Cup semi-final on home soil. In the past two years, she has been forced to step away from soccer to tackle her anxiety. Sitting down with Tara Rushton for 10 News+, the star striker opens up about her mental health battle, and explains why she is ready to return to the sport and represent her country once again.  Seven men have been arrested in Queensland during overnight raids, accused of being part of an international syndicate that was behind the thefts of $9 million worth of cars. Authorities say the men used high-tech tools to steal around 60 SUVs from suburban driveways between October and December 2025, which were then allegedly hidden in shipping containers and sent to the United Arab Emirates for sale.

Trump has argued Denmark - a NATO member - has not done enough to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region, and the proposed acquisition would be best for America's national security.  The United Nations and the European Union have strongly opposed Trump's pursuit of Greenland, with the latter stating it will remain an ""unwavering champion of international law and multilateralism"".

The incident has been met with outrage by city authorities, including the Minneapolis Mayor, Jacob Frey, who tersely told ICE agents to ""get the f**k out"" of his city in a press conference.  Frey was visibly angry speaking to media following the incident, and baulked at the Trump administration's claim that the agent was acting in self-defence.  ""They're already trying to spin it as an action of self-defence. Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit,"" Frey said.  A 37-year-old woman has been confirmed as the victim in the shooting, the latest violent incident in ICE's and President Donald Trump's nationwide crackdown on migrants.

2026-01-08T01:38:26+00:00,US Seizes Oil Tankers To Enforce Oil Sanctions On Venezuela | 10 News,"The United States has seized two oil tankers in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean in a bid to enforce sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports.  US forces boarded the Russian-flagged Marinera tanker in waters between Iceland and Scotland, supported by the UK Royal Navy.  The Marinera, formerly known as the Bella-1, had no oil but the US has alleged it was breaking US sanctions and belongs to a “shadow fleet” used to transport oil from Venezuela and Iran.  Moscow’s transport ministry has condemned the seizure of the Marinera, but given flags were allegedly repeatedly changed, the US claims this makes the vessel “stateless” – which can be legally boarded.  The M Sophia was also boarded by the US in the Caribbean, accused of conducting illicit activities. Venezuela's leadership is allegedly co-operating, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  Rubio says the US plans to control how the oil from Venezuela is sold in a way that benefits both Venezuela and the United States.
