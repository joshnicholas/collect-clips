It was also revealed $3,000 was spent on Wells’ family joining her on a work trip to Thredbo, and $9,000 spent on family travel for three AFL grand finals.  An Australia Post delivery driver was caught on camera throwing a package that was marked ‘fragile’, sending it flying through the air. Australia Post told 10 News+ the postie’s actions “did not align with the standard we expect” and that the matter will be managed through their “internal disciplinary process”. However, it doesn’t seem like an isolated issue. A Facebook page dedicated to Australia Post complaints has garnered over 30,000 followers.  South Australia’s Premier Peter Malinauskas, who is one of the architects of Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, has defended the controversial world-first legislation. He says the ban will have a major impact on children’s online safety, but also concedes that the way the ban is enforced will not be perfect. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also released a video message to kids, urging them to take on new real-world hobbies and spend more time with loved ones in the upcoming school holidays, instead of scrolling on phones.  The boss of TPG Telecom has revealed to a Senate inquiry that a second person may have died after they failed to connect to Triple Zero using an older Samsung phone. Inaki Berroeta says the death happened on September 24 in New South Wales’ Blue Mountains. A TPG customer, who was using a Samsung handset, tried to call emergency services but was unable to. TPG says it was only informed of the incident on Monday, a claim challenged by Telstra, whose CEO Vicki Brady says Telstra knew of the death on the day it happened and notified the government, which notified TPG.
