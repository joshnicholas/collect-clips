2026-01-28T23:39:15+00:00,Invasion Day Rally Bomb Scare Deemed 'Potential Terrorist Attack' | 10 News,"Authorities are now investigating the alleged bomb attack at Perth’s Invasion Day rally as a potential terrorist act, after initially treating it as a hostile incident.  WA Police allege a 31-year-old man threw a device packed with screws, ball bearings and explosive liquid into a crowd of about 2,500 people in the CBD.  The device did not detonate, and no one was injured, but police described it as a potential mass-casualty event.  The Joint Counter Terrorism Team confirmed the reclassification followed growing concern over why the incident was not initially labelled terrorism.  First Nations leaders and organisers accused authorities of downplaying the attack, saying it would have been called terrorism if another group was targeted.  Police say investigations into motive are ongoing, with further charges not ruled out, and there is no ongoing threat to public safety.
