Former High Court judge Virginia Bell is at the helm, and the commission will replace the already announced New South Wales state-based inquiry, and incorporate the review run by former spy chief Dennis Richardson, who will deliver his interim report in April. Jenny Roytur, the niece of Bondi victim Boris Tetleroyd, spoke to 10 News+ about her reaction to the Prime Minister’s announcement.  Victoria is facing the most hazardous heatwave conditions since the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, with the South-West, Wimmera, Northern Country and North Central regions issued a catastrophic fire danger rating. Residents of up to a dozen towns are being told to evacuate, as a bushfire currently burning in Longwood continues to spread. A second blaze east of Wodonga is also burning out of control.  Queensland’s north-west has been devastated by a deluge of floodwater after weeks of torrential rain. Farmers are bracing for huge losses, with around 30,000 head of livestock estimated to be dead or missing. Local grazier Beau Harrington from Julia Creek’s Brinard Station spoke to 10 News+ about the harrowing experience of dealing with the destruction from the heart of the floods.  America is once again on edge after Renee Good, a US citizen, was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The mayor of Minneapolis told ICE to “get the f*ck out” of the city, while US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the shooting, saying Good had tried to run over the officer before he opened fire.
