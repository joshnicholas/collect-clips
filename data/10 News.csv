2026-01-27T02:17:23+00:00,Netanyahu Announces Return Of Last Israeli Hostage Ran Gvili’s Body From Gaza | 10 News,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the remains of the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza, police officer Ran Gvili, have been found and identified.  The 24-year-old was killed during the October 7, 2023 attacks and his body was taken into Gaza, where it remained for nearly two and a half years.  The IDF recovered his remains following a search operation in eastern Gaza City, with identification confirmed through dental records.  Netanyahu called the recovery an “incredible achievement”, saying Israel had fulfilled its pledge to return all hostages, living and dead.  Hamas says it helped provide intelligence on the location but faced difficulties recovering the body due to Israeli-controlled areas and ongoing military operations.  With no hostages now held in Gaza, Israel says it will move to reopen the Rafah Crossing under agreed conditions with the United States.
