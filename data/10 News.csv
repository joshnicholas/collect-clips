He has been stripped of his royal titles and will be evicted from his home. The move by his brother King Charles comes after mounting pressure from parliamentarians and the public to take action against the Royal pariah, over allegations he sexually assaulted the late Jeffrey Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.  Researchers believe they may have discovered a new dinosaur species called Nanotyrannus in 67 million-year-old fossils found in Montana in 2006. One of the skeletons was initially thought to be a young Tyrannosaurus rex, but a new research paper suggests otherwise.   Australians are developing quite a love for Halloween, with a whopping $2.3 billion set to be spent this spooky season.

Survivors who escaped to Tawila say fighters rounded up civilians, separated men from women and shot detainees after hurling racial slurs, with satellite analysis suggesting systematic ethnic-based killings.  Reuters and UN-verified videos show RSF fighters shooting captives and bodies scattered across streets, despite RSF denials and claims of “media exaggeration”.  Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab says violence mirrors early stages of the Rwandan genocide, describing “door-to-door clearance operations” targeting non-Arab communities.  International concern is growing amid accusations the UAE armed RSF forces, allegations it denies, as aid agencies warn tens of thousands remain trapped and unaccounted for.
