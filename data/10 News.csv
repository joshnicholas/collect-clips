U.S. President Donald Trump said Maduro and his wife were “captured and flown out of the country” following what he described as a “large-scale strike” by U.S. forces.  Trump added that the United States would temporarily place Venezuela under American control, deploying U.S. forces “if necessary.”  Speaking to the media, Trump said, “So, I’d like to do it quickly, but it takes a period of time. You know, we’re rebuilding… we have to rebuild their whole infrastructure. The infrastructure is rotted. It’s actually very dangerous.”  Maduro and his wife arrived in New York on Saturday to face federal charges related to drug trafficking and alleged cooperation with gangs designated as terrorist organizations. Maduro has denied the accusations.  Maduro’s removal after more than 12 years in power has raised concerns about a potential power vacuum in Venezuela.
