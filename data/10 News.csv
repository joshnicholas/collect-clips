The outage impacted automated passport gates, so every inbound and outbound international passenger was affected. It follows an Airbus software glitch which saw mass cancellations and delays of Jetstar flights, which was resolved today.  An anti-immigration protest organised by Put Australia First marched along Flinders St in Melbourne’s CBD, with heavy police presence as a counter-rally unfolded nearby at the State Library of Victoria. One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson addressed the anti-immigration rally, and was interrupted by a counter-protestor with a loudspeaker, who was promptly ordered to move on by police.  A new television ad in Ireland is warning parents about the dangers of oversharing about their children on social media. The campaign, called ‘Pause Before You Post’ explains that digital information from photos can be used for predators to learn specific details about kids, and just 20 images is enough to build a convincing AI deepfake of a child.  One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson’s donning of the burka was widely condemned, but eye-catching political stunts are nothing new in Australia. To gain attention, politicians have performed stunts with wild costumes that cause offence, but more often than not, they are silly and sometimes plain absurd.
