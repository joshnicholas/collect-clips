2025-12-20T03:13:40+00:00,Epstein Files Released As Pressure Mounts For Full Disclosure | 10 News,"The US Justice Department has released hundreds of thousands of pages from its investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, following a new transparency law passed by Congress.  The first batch of documents was made public on Friday, with officials saying more records are still under review and will be released in the coming weeks.  Many of the files were heavily redacted to protect victims and ongoing investigations, and it remains unclear how much new information they contain.  The documents include multiple references and photos of former US president Bill Clinton, while making scant mention of President Donald Trump.  Lawmakers have criticised delays in the rollout, saying the law requires all unclassified Epstein-related material to be made public.
