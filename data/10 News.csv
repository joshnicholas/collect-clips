The White House has also insisted military action is not off the table. Greenland, the world’s largest island, is strategically important because it sits on a pivotal maritime passage, along with Iceland and the UK, that links the Arctic to the North Atlantic. It’s also rich in natural resources including oil, gas and rare earth minerals, which can be used to manufacture everything from electric cars to military equipment.  Cortnee Vine is known as the Matildas’ match-winner and the golden girl who led Australia to a World Cup semi-final on home soil. In the past two years, she has been forced to step away from soccer to tackle her anxiety. Sitting down with Tara Rushton for 10 News+, the star striker opens up about her mental health battle, and explains why she is ready to return to the sport and represent her country once again.  Seven men have been arrested in Queensland during overnight raids, accused of being part of an international syndicate that was behind the thefts of $9 million worth of cars. Authorities say the men used high-tech tools to steal around 60 SUVs from suburban driveways between October and December 2025, which were then allegedly hidden in shipping containers and sent to the United Arab Emirates for sale.
