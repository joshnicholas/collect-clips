Its military is accused of attacking the besieged territory dozens of times since the truce began, killing Palestinians and destroying buildings. The country’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has just given an interview with Australian commentator Erin Molan, who is a staunch supporter of Israel.  UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s government is in crisis, as rumours swirl of an internal plot to oust him as leader of the Labour Party. One of the frontbench MPs named as being behind the ‘planned coup’, Health Secretary Wes Streeting, has publicly denied it. And now the embattled PM has been forced to deny that his own office was responsible for starting the rumours.  Two experts on artificial intelligence have delivered a terrifying warning - that AI will lead to the extinction of humanity, possibly in our lifetime, if something isn’t done to stop its harm. The authors of the new book ‘If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies’ say that if AI becomes smarter than humans, it could develop its own goals, deceive its creators, and gain power over us all. They are telling governments to act quickly, to stop the development of ‘super AI’.
