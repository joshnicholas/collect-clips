According to an Israeli military spokesperson, the strikes were targeting Hezbollah and Hamas military infrastructure in Hammara and Ain el-Tineh in eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, and Kfar Hatta and Aanan in the south. The strikes came after evacuation orders were issued for four villages in the country’s east and south. The attacks are seen as a breach of the US‑brokered ceasefire agreed in late 2024, which halted more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Since then, both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire.
