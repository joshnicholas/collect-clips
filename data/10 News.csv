2025-11-18T22:14:05+00:00,Trump Silences Reporter Calling Her ‘Piggy’ During Air Force One Exchange | 10 News,"Donald Trump is under fire after telling Bloomberg White House correspondent Catherine Lucey “quiet piggy” during a press conference aboard Air Force One.   Lucey had been pressing the president on the looming release of Jeffrey Epstein files when he pointed at her and used the insult - a remark that went largely unnoticed until it resurfaced days later, drawing widespread condemnation from fellow journalists.  Industry figures - including Jake Tapper and Gretchen Carlson - labelled the comment “disgusting”, while the International Women’s Media Foundation said Trump’s appearance-based insults are part of a longstanding pattern of trying to silence female reporters.  Bloomberg defended Lucey’s work, saying its journalists “perform a vital public service”, as the White House attempted to justify the outburst by blaming the reporter, without offering any evidence.

Minaj’s involvement has sparked criticism from those who say she is amplifying a distorted narrative, while supporters argue her platform brings needed attention to overlooked atrocities.   The dispute comes as Washington restores Nigeria to its religious freedom watchlist, further straining relations between the two countries.
