GP clinics will be offered more financial incentives if they provide free appointments to any Medicare card holder. For women, the federal government scheme also includes larger rebates for menopause health assessments and long-term contraceptives.  Revered 'Fawlty Towers' actress Prunella Scales, known for her hilariously deadpan portrayla of Sybil, has died aged 93. Her witty performance as the hotel's matron, alongside her bumbling husband, played by John Cleese, cemented Scales as a bastion of dry British humor.   Queensland’s curriculum authority has been put on notice by the state’s Education Minister, as the number of high schools involved in a major teaching blunder has risen to nine. 140 Ancient History students across the state were taught about the Ancient Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar, instead of his grand-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar.
