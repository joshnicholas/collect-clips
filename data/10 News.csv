The outage impacted automated passport gates, so every inbound and outbound international passenger was affected. It follows an Airbus software glitch which saw mass cancellations and delays of Jetstar flights, which was resolved today.  An anti-immigration protest organised by Put Australia First marched along Flinders St in Melbourne’s CBD, with heavy police presence as a counter-rally unfolded nearby at the State Library of Victoria. One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson addressed the anti-immigration rally, and was interrupted by a counter-protestor with a loudspeaker, who was promptly ordered to move on by police.  A new television ad in Ireland is warning parents about the dangers of oversharing about their children on social media.
