The move comes after a negotiation with eSafety Commissioner Julia Inman Grant, who confirmed Roblox was threatened with fines if they failed to comply. Grant expressed she had concerns, prior to the agreement, that Roblox was becoming a “playground for paedophiles.”   Today was the final sign off for talkback titan John Laws, who has been farewelled at a state funeral in Sydney’s CBD. Russell Crowe, Barnaby Joyce, Marcia Hines and Dawn Fraser were all among the attendees who came together to remember “the golden tonsils.”  It’s been 80 years since Thomas the Tank Engine chugged onto our screens, and the locomotive is still changing lives today. 15-year-old superfan Cody has been obsessed with Thomas & Friends from toddlerhood. Thomas & Friends became the bridge that helped therapists connect with him and break through barriers in communication and play.   Experts are warning that social media is keeping us angry and online, trapping us in a vicious cycle. 10 News+ spoke to Annie Knight, the OnlyFans star behind multiple controversial sex stunts, about how 'rage baiting' can be one of the most effective tools for a content creator.
