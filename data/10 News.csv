2026-01-12T07:33:47+00:00,"500 Killed In Iran Protests, Victoria Bushfires Continue, Rose Byrne Wins Golden Globe | 10 News+","Inspector Amy Scott, the hero police officer who took down the Bondi Junction stabber Joel Cauchi in 2024, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. There has been an outpouring of care from the community, her colleagues saying the mum of two is surrounded by love. A fundraiser set up for the hero cop has passed $170,000 and is still climbing, with everyday Aussies leaving heartfelt messages of support.  Sydney’s very own Rose Byrne has won big at the Golden Globes, winning the category of Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical for her performance in ‘If I Had Legs I’d Kick You’. She plays a woman named Linda who starts to lose her mind while juggling her daughter’s illness, her absent husband, her hostile relationship with her therapist, and a mysterious hole in her ceiling. Other Australians nominated this year include Jacob Elordi, Sarah Snook, and Joel Edgerton who all missed out on an award.  Mass protests in Iran have entered a third week, the unrest growing bigger and bloodier each day. Harrowing video smuggled out of the country shows hundreds of body bags lining the streets of the capital Tehran. The ruling Islamic regime has imposed an internet and cellular blackout, isolating Iranians from the outside world. 10 News+ spoke to Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an Australian academic and expert in Middle Eastern politics, who spent two years in an Iranian jail on false charges of espionage.  The debate over Australia Day is back in conversation due to a new petition gaining traction online. The organisations say their solution could end the division. The idea is to move Australia Day from its current date to the second last Monday in January, meaning it will always fall between January 18 and January 24, leaving January 26 to be a national day of mourning and reflection.
