2025-11-13T23:58:37+00:00,Settlers Torch West Bank Mosque As Violence Surges And Condemnations Grow | 10 News,"Israeli settlers have torched and vandalised a mosque in the West Bank town of Deir Istiya, burning copies of the Quran and spray-painting threatening messages in an escalation of attacks on Palestinian communities.  The assault comes just days after Israeli leaders, including the president and military chiefs, issued rare condemnations of settler violence following a separate rampage that saw cars, property and even soldiers targeted.  Troops were sent to investigate Thursday’s arson, but no suspects have been identified, fuelling long-standing claims that settlers operate with near-total impunity under Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government.  UN monitors say settler attacks have reached record levels, displacing thousands of Palestinians as new outposts sprawl further across occupied land.
