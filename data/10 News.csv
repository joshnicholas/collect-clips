2025-12-06T04:51:44+00:00,Donald Trump Awarded Controversial FIFA Peace Prize At World Cup 2026 Draw | 10 News,"FIFA President Gianni Infantino sparked controversy by awarding Donald Trump the first-ever FIFA peace prize - with no listed nominees or finalists and no vote by FIFA’s Council - ahead of the 2026 World Cup draw.  The award was presented on stage at Washington’s Kennedy Centre by FIFA President Gianni Infantino.  Trump called it “one of the great honours” and claimed “we saved millions of lives.”  Trump has made disputed claims about conflicts he has “ended,” despite launching controversial military actions and facing criticism that his self-proclaimed peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine were one-sided and ineffective.  Infantino praised Trump’s role in the Abrahams Accord, the Gaza peace deal and the Rwanda-DRC agreement.  The move has drawn scrutiny given FIFA’s own rules requiring political neutrality in dealings with governments.
