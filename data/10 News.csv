2025-11-26T08:05:58+00:00,"Social Media AI Misinformation, Danger Ahead In Fire Season, Robert Irwin’s Dancing Win | 10 News+","Australia’s world-first social media ban for under-16s will kick in on December 10, 2025. 10 News+ put questions to X and Meta’s artificial intelligence chatbot systems, and found that they are telling children how to dodge the new rules. It comes as Anthony Albanese faced a grilling in Canberra from young people who probed the PM about how the ban will impact their daily lives.  Earlier this year, inflation was heading in the right direction. Now, it’s rising again, with the latest data showing it jump to 3.8 per cent in October, which remains well above the Reserve Bank of Australia’s target range for inflation of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. It has dashed hopes of an interest rate cut anytime soon, putting more pressure on cost of living for families as they head into the new year.  The Walkabout Creek Hotel, in the outback Queensland town of McKinlay, has found new ownership after three years on the market. The pub was made famous when it was featured in the classic film ‘Crocodile Dundee’ nearly four decades ago. 10 News+ was joined by local cattle grazier Angus Brodie, who now owns the pub with his wife Jo Cranney.  Australians are expected to spend over $6 billion during Black Friday sales, but consumer advocates are warning us to hit pause before we buy. A new CHOICE survey is showing that 53 per cent of Aussies have regretted a Black Friday purchase or had a bad experience over the weekend of sales. Liam Kennedy from CHOICE joined 10 News+ to talk about how consumers can avoid buyer's remorse.
