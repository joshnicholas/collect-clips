Naomi Walsh, who first set up the cupboard outside her home in 2016, says it operates on a “Give what you can, take what you can use” philosophy. The pop-up pantry which serves those in need has become so popular that it now also acts as a free street library and nursery.  Sussan Ley has been publicly slammed by her own colleague, Victorian Senator Sarah Henderson, who says the Opposition Leader is “losing support”. Henderson wants the Liberals to join the Nationals in ditching their net zero by 2050 policy, when the party decides its position next week. Ley refused to respond, saying she should not be expected to “comment on commentary”.

The storm tore through central Vietnam with winds of up to 149km/h, uprooting trees, ripping roofs from homes and forcing mass evacuations as hundreds of thousands sought shelter.  In the Philippines, torrential rain triggered deadly floods and landslides that wiped out entire neighbourhoods and buried homes under mud, prompting a nationwide state of calamity.  Relief operations are now underway across both countries, with Vietnam’s prime minister vowing that “no one should be left hungry or cold” as the weakened storm moves toward Cambodia and Laos.

The Sulfur Cave web houses around 110,000 spiders from two newly identified species, the first time these usually solitary creatures have been seen living together.  Researchers describe the discovery as “extraordinary,” suggesting the colony thrives thanks to an endless supply of midges deep underground.
