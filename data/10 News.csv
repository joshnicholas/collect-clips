2025-11-06T23:40:28+00:00,Trump Says ‘It’s Safe To Fly’ As FAA Cuts Air Traffic By 10 Per Cent Amid Shutdown | 10 News,"Donald Trump has insisted “it’s safe to fly,” even as the FAA prepares to slash air traffic by 10 per cent across 40 major US airports amid the record-breaking government shutdown.  Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump defended the move as ensuring “100 per cent safety” for passengers, while dismissing concerns about mounting flight delays and unpaid air traffic controllers.  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA chief Bryan Bedford said the cuts, expected to affect major hubs including New York, Washington DC, Chicago and Los Angeles, aim to reduce pressure on fatigued staff who have gone more than a month without pay.  The shutdown, now in its 36th day, has already caused widespread airport disruptions and staffing shortages.   Trump again urged Senate Republicans to scrap the filibuster rule to pass legislation and took a swipe at outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling her “an evil woman who did a poor job.”  Join the conversation and follow us on: Twitter: http://twitter.com/10NewsAU Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/10NewsAU/ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/10NewsAU/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@10NewsAU 10 News airs at 5pm, seven nights a week in your local market on Network 10.
