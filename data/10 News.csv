2025-11-05T23:21:41+00:00,Trump Attacks Zohran Mamdani’s Historic NYC Win As Democrats Sweep Major US Races | 10 News,"US President Donald Trump has attacked Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani’s landmark victory in New York City, calling it a loss of “sovereignty”.  Speaking at a Miami forum marking a year since his re-election, Trump praised his economic record, saying, “We have the greatest economy right now. A lot of people don’t see that,” but offered few new ideas, instead revisiting familiar themes of crime, immigration and opposition to transgender rights.  His remarks came after Democrats swept key races across the country, winning governorships in New Jersey and Virginia, the mayoralty in New York City, and a major California ballot initiative to redraw congressional districts in response to Republican-led efforts elsewhere.  While Trump warned Mamdani’s win showed the rise of “radical policies,” observers say it signals a deepening appetite for progressive change, with voters embracing Mamdani’s platform of wealth redistribution, free childcare and expanded public services.
