2025-12-16T00:17:21+00:00,"Jimmy Lai Guilty In Hong Kong National Security Case, Faces Possible Life Sentence | 10 News","A Hong Kong court has found prominent media mogul and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai guilty of sedition and collusion under Beijing’s national security law.  The 78-year-old founder of the now-closed ‘Apple Daily’ was accused of using his newspaper to publish seditious material and work with foreign forces to undermine national security.  The verdict marks the most high-profile case yet under the sweeping law imposed after the city’s 2019 pro-democracy protests, drawing widespread international condemnation.  Supporters - including the United States and the United Kingdom - say the charges are politically motivated and designed to silence one of Hong Kong’s most outspoken critics of China.  Lai, a fierce opponent of President Xi Jinping’s tightening control over the city, has pleaded not guilty and now awaits sentencing, which could include life in prison.
