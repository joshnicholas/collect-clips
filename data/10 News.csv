2026-01-15T22:38:15+00:00,Machado Presents Trump With Nobel Peace Prize | 10 News,"Venezuelan Opposition Leader María Corina Machado says she ""presented"" her Nobel Peace Prize award to US President Donald Trump during their meeting at the White House.  Trump has long been known to covet the medal, believing it should be awarded to him due to his administration's record of ending conflicts across the globe.  The Nobel Peace Prize Committee has said that the award and title cannot be transferred.  “As the Norwegian Nobel Committee states: ‘Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.’ A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot,” the Committee said in a social media post.  It is unclear whether President Trump accepted the Peace Prize.  Early in December, Trump was awarded the newly-created FIFA Peace Prize at the 2026 FIFA World Cup Draw, with the tournament set to be held across the United States, Canada and Mexico.
