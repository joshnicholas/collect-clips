2025-10-29T00:24:31+00:00,Alleged Drug Strikes Kill 14 In Pacific Ocean | 10 News,"The US military has once again come under scrutiny after launching strikes on four suspected drug-smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific, killing 14 people and leaving one survivor.   Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the vessels were linked to “designated terrorist organisations,” but legal experts have questioned the basis for using lethal force outside of war zones.   The Trump administration reportedly approved a classified opinion allowing traffickers to be treated as enemy combatants, a move critics say bypasses judicial oversight and international law.   Mexican authorities have taken charge of rescuing the survivor after being informed by Washington.   It’s the latest in a growing series of strikes raising ethical and legal concerns about the US’s expanding anti-narcotics campaign.
