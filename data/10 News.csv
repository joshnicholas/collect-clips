2025-11-06T08:12:46+00:00,"Trump Slams Zohran Mamdani, New Survey On Masculinity, Miss Universe Mass Walkout | 10 News+","Some residents of Mosman, in Sydney’s affluent Lower North Shore, are railing against a proposal to add 500 extra homes in their suburb. They are taking the state government to court, and have even hired one of Australia’s best jingle writers to compose a new protest song.  A national study has highlighted the dangers that young men face if they hold onto rigid and outdated ideas of what it is to be a man. The Adolescent Man Box Survey found that boys aged between 14 and 18 who identify with hyper-masculine stereotypes are not only more miserable and lonely, but also more likely to harm others, particularly women.  Donald Trump has erupted over Zohran Mamdani’s landslide victory in New York City’s mayoral election, saying it is “not good for anybody”. The US President also falsely branded Mamdani, who is a self-described democratic socialist, as a “communist”. The 34-year-old mayor-elect campaigned on cost of living, and will soon become the first Muslim mayor of America’s largest city.  Contestants at the 2025 Miss Universe Pageant, which is being held in Thailand, staged a mass walkout of the event after an event official publicly berated Miss Mexico and called her “dumb”. Miss Mexico remained defiant after the incident, saying “No one can shut our voice and no one will do that to me”.
