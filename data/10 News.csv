2025-10-27T22:02:43+00:00,Trump Again Refuses To Rule Out Third Presidential Run | 10 News,"US President Donald Trump has once again refused to categorically rule out attempting to run for a third presidential term, further stoking rising fears he may try to subvert the US constitution.  The constitution's 22nd amendment prevents anyone from being elected to the office of president more than twice. However, this hasn't stopped rampant speculation that Trump will mount a move to either remain in office in 2028, or find a legal workaround to permit a third tilt at the presidency.  Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked point-blank if he would rule out a third run. ""Am I ruling it out? You tell me,"" he responded. Trump did, however, address one popularly held theory that he could run as Vice President behind JD Vance, with Vance immediately stepping down after winning an election. Despite that too being constitutionally forbidden, Trump said he would not do it because ""it's too cute.""

2025-10-27T23:36:39+00:00,King Charles Heckled Over Prince Andrew’s Ties To Epstein Outside Cathedral | 10 News,"King Charles was heckled by a protester over Prince Andrew’s ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when greeting royal fans outside Lichfield Cathedral in north-west England. ""How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?"" the man could be heard shouting at the monarch.  “Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew, Sir?""  Although Prince Andrew recently said that he would give up using his title of Duke of York after years of scrutiny over his behaviour and connections to Epstein, questions about him and what the royals knew of events have grown.  Virginia Giuffre’s memoir, in which she accused the prince of sexually abusing her as a teenager, has added fuel to the fire.  The prince has always denied her account.  The monarch paid no attention to the protester and carried on engaging with other members of the public.
