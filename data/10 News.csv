Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump threatened possible military action against Colombia, saying such an operation “sounds good to me,” and referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as a “sick man.”  The comments come in the wake of a US operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and brought him to New York to face drug-trafficking charges. Trump said he believes the capture will have repercussions for neighbouring countries that rely on trade from Venezuela.  He also addressed Cuba, suggesting intervention may not be necessary because the island nation is close to collapse, and added that Mexico “has to get their act together.”  Join the conversation and follow us on: TikTok: http://www.tiktok.com/@10NewsAU/ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/10NewsAU/ Twitter: http://twitter.com/10NewsAU Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/10NewsAU/  10 News airs at 5pm, seven nights a week in your local market on Network 10.
