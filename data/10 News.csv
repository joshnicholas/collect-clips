2026-02-12T01:20:46+00:00,Does Australia Get More Tax From Beer Than Gas?,"Do Australians pay more tax on beer than international gas companies pay on the Australian offshore gas they export?  During a Senate Estimates hearing on Thursday, Independent Senator David Pocock asked Treasury Deputy Secretary Shane Johnson to compare the estimated income from the excise on beer to the estimated profits from PRRT (petroleum resource rent tax), exposing that Australian beer drinkers pay an estimated $1.2b more on tax than large corporations do on offshore gas processing.  The PRRT was introduced in 1988 to ensure Australians benefit from the oil and gas extracted from Australian land. However, gas companies have exploited loopholes to avoid the tax by understating the value of the gas they sell.  Beer drinkers and producers in Australia face some of the highest tax rates in the world, with consumers paying over $20 in tax per slab of full-strength beer sold at bottle shops.
