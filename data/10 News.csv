The fake girl’s account was flooded with make-up tips, dancing videos and instructions on extreme dieting. The fake boy’s account was very different - filled with pranks, sexualised content, and schoolyard brawls.  Network Political Editor Ashleigh Raper sat down with Julie Inman Grant, Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, who opened up about the journey to getting the nationwide under-16s social media ban into effect. Grant admits there will be “teething issues” with the ban’s rollout, and says parents are able to report any incidents of social media platforms not complying with the ban.  10 News+ sat down with teenage girls from St Joseph’s Catholic College on the New South Wales Central Coast who have been saving photos and memories from their favourite apps in preparation for the social media ban for under-16s. Tilly, Coco, Helen and Imogen are aged 14 and 15 years old and label the harmful content spreading online as ‘demoralising’, ‘toxic’, ‘influential’ and ‘unsafe’. They all agree there is a problem, but have differing views on the ban and question if it will work.  Chloe Mowday, an Australian mother of three, has been left in a coma and on life support after travelling overseas for a cosmetic procedure. Mowday went to Vietnam for rhinoplasty, commonly referred to as a ‘nose job’, and some surgery on her eyelids. The day after her procedure, she went downhill and had to be put in an induced coma in hospital, with her organs starting to shut down.
