2026-01-19T23:00:46+00:00,Starmer Slams Trump’s Greenland Tariffs As EU Vows To Defend Against Coercion | 10 News,"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticised Donald Trump’s plan to impose 10 per cent tariffs on eight European nations over opposition to American control of Greenland, warning a trade war is “completely wrong” and not in anyone’s interest.  Trump has set a February start date for the import tax, escalating tensions with NATO allies after some deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland, which he argues is crucial for a US missile defence system.  Starmer said Britain will keep dialogue open and won’t “pretend differences don’t exist,” but indicated the UK is not considering retaliatory measures.  EU leaders say they are prepared to defend against economic “coercion,” as Denmark and Greenland hold planned talks with NATO officials on Arctic security.
