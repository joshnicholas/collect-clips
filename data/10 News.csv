Thousands took to the streets of Tehran’s Punak Square on Saturday night, with cheers and the sound of people banging pots filling the air.

Iran’s Attorney General, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an “enemy of God” a charge that carries the death penalty.  Meanwhile in London, a man was seen tearing down the current Iranian flag and replacing it with the Lion and Sun flag, which was used in the country before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
