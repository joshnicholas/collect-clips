2025-12-17T08:04:53+00:00,"Alleged Bondi Gunman Charged, Tom Silvagni Sentenced, Sydney Sweeney's New Film | 10 News+","The first funerals for the victims of Sunday’s Bondi Beach mass shooting have been held, including for beloved Rabbi Eli Schlanger. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns was in attendance at the service at Chabad of Bondi synagogue, which was overflowing with crowds of mourners.  Former Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has slammed Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, delivering a passionate 50-minute speech at a Bondi Beach vigil in front of mourners and news crews. The former politician, who is Jewish, urged the PM to “take personal responsibility” for Sunday’s mass shooting, saying the government has “failed” the Jewish community. He also offered an 8-point plan of what the Government should do - taking aim at everything from neo-Nazis, the immigration system, Islamic extremism, and pro-Palestine protests.  Tom Silvagni has been sentenced to six years and two months in jail after he was found guilty of rape earlier this month. The non-parole period is three years and three months. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Greg Lyon said Silvagni has not shown remorse for his offending.  US President Donald Trump says an end to the war in Ukraine is “closer than ever”. It comes after Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner in Berlin, along with a dozen European heads of state. The United States now says a consensus has been reached on 90 per cent of the topics discussed.  In Hollywood, it’s still rare for two women to lead a major studio film. Yet in ‘The Housemaid’, a new thriller based on the 2022 mega-hit book of the same name, actresses Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried share top billing. Both Sweeney and Seyfried have dominated headlines this year for reasons other than their film work. Sweeney copped online criticism over a controversial jeans ad, and Seyfried for her comments on slain conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. Now they’re both soaking up the spotlight as positive early reactions to ‘The Housemaid’ pour in.
