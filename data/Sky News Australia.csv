While speaking to reporters on Air Force One, President Trump also asserted that the latest Epstein file release absolves him.  “I didn't see it myself, but I was told by some very important people that not only does it absolve me, it's the opposite of what people were hoping, you know, the radical left, that Wolff who is a third rate writer, was conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to hurt me, politically or otherwise, and that came through loud and clear. So we'll probably sue Wolff on that,” Trump said.  A reporter followed up on Trump’s remark, asking the president again if he was “going to sue the Epstein estate”.  “I guess so, because he was conspiring with Wolff to do harm to me politically.
