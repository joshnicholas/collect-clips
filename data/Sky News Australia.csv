Jean-Pierre recently appeared on MSNBC’s ‘The Weekend: Primetime’ as she continues to promote her new book ‘Independent’.  Near the end of the segment and interview, co-host Ayman Mohyeldin asked KJP if she had “any regrets” during her time as press secretary.  Jean-Pierre briefly hesitated to answer the simple question before Mohyeldin chimed in and said, “It’s just a simple yes or no”, resulting in a bizarre answer.  “No, no, no, no, because you’re asking for a yes or no question. I want to put some context to it, too. I woke up every day, very proud to be the White House press secretary,” she said.  “I woke up every day as a Black woman who is queer, who no one had ever seen someone like me at that podium, standing behind that lectern.”",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clRU_YnMdzg,Sky News Australia
