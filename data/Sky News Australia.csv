On Tuesday, Goldberg revealed her name appeared in the files and claimed she was addressing it “in the name of transparency”.  Goldberg's name was mentioned in a 2013 email, where an individual says she needs a plane to Monaco and that “John Lennon's charity is paying for it”.  The actress claimed that the email should have said Julian Lennon’s charity, adding that it went on to ask Epstein if he would offer his plane to Goldberg.  Fellow co-host Joy Behar claimed that “anybody can be on this list”, before Goldberg defended herself for appearing in the files.  Well, this is my point. Because I’m telling you, when I tell you people are trying to turn me into, I wasn’t his girlfriend. I wasn’t his friend,” Goldberg said.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0JKV8qBGIQ,Sky News Australia
