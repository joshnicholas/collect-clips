2026-02-20T03:34:56+00:00,Disgraced and Detained: The Fall of Andrew | 9 News Australia,"War hero. Queen’s favorite son. The Duke of York. Born into a life of duty, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was once a pillar of the Monarchy—until his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein triggered a historic collapse.  For the first time in generations, a British Prince has been arrested.  This documentary traces the complete, harrowing timeline of Andrew’s downfall. From the explosive 2019 Newsnight interview and the ""Pizza Express"" alibi to the multi-million-dollar settlement with Virginia Giuffre. We go inside the final, historic move by King Charles III to strip his brother of all royal titles and honors.  The Breaking Point: While Andrew has long denied sexual assault allegations, he now faces a devastating new legal reality. We investigate his recent arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office—a charge linked to his ties with Epstein that has finally forced him into exile.
