2026-01-15T21:48:03+00:00,"Hate Speech bill in CHAOS: Opposition calls it ""Unsalvageable"" | 9 News Australia","The Federal Government’s proposed hate speech and doxxing legislation is facing a critical deadlock in Canberra, with the bill's future now hanging in the balance. In this heated segment from The Today Show, the political divide widens as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s push to rush the bill through parliament meets fierce resistance from both the Coalition and the Greens.  Despite the Prime Minister’s call for national unity and a desire to pass the reforms quickly, the bill has been criticized from all sides. The Coalition argues the legislation is rushed and flawed, while the Greens are pushing for broader protections, leaving the government scrambling to find the numbers needed to pass it in the Senate.  Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley joins the program from Adelaide to deliver a scathing critique of the bill, labeling it ""unsalvageable."" Ley argues that the Opposition was not consulted on the design of the legislation and claims it fails to address the root causes of recent violence, specifically naming ""radical Islamic extremism"" and antisemitism. She contends that the bill contains ""escape clauses"" for hate preachers and questions why specific ideologies are not explicitly named in the text. Ley emphasizes that the Jewish community does not feel safe and asserts that the current bill does nothing to rectify that, referencing the tragic Bondi Junction stabbings as a failure of current counter-terrorism responses.  In response, Minister for Communications Anika Wells fires back, accusing the Opposition of playing politics during a time of national crisis. Wells dismisses Ley's comments as ""talking tough"" and describes the Coalition as a ""rabble"" with a divided voting record. She defends the government's approach, stating they are open to amendments and willing to negotiate to get the reforms passed. However, when pressed on who the government will actually negotiate with to secure the votes, Wells remains vague, insisting they will work with ""whomever we need to.""  Watch the full debate to understand the arguments threatening to sink one of the year’s most controversial political bills. | *Subscribe and 🔔: http://9Soci.al/KM6e50GjSK9*  CHAPTERS  00:00 - Government's Hate Speech Bill in Limbo 01:03 - Interview: Deputy Opposition Leader Sussan Ley 02:37 - Ley Calls Legislation ""Unsalvageable"" 05:25 - Debate Over Naming ""Radical Islamic Extremism"" 08:00 - Interview: Communications Minister Anika Wells 09:10 - Government’s Plan B & Path to Passing the Bill 10:01 - Wells Calls the Opposition a ""Rabble""  *Get more breaking news at 9News.com.au: http://9Soci.al/iyCO50GjSK6*  FOLLOW 9News Australia ► Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/9News/ ► Twitter: https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS ► Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/9news/  Join 9News for the latest in news and events that affect you in your local city, as well as news from across Australia and the world.  #9News #BreakingNews #NineNewsAustralia #9NewsAU",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZddNGTlWiUw,9News
