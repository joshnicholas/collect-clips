2026-01-22T21:29:00+00:00,'How long before they knife you? Ley & Littleproud on Coalition split | 9 News Australia,"Liberal MPs could call time on Sussan Ley's leadership as early as February after the Nationals walked out on the coalition for the second time in less than a year. The Australian political landscape has been thrown into chaos as the Liberal-National Coalition splits for the second time in less than a year. In this explosive segment from the Today show, we cover the dramatic fallout as the Nationals walk away from the opposition partnership, leaving Liberal Leader Sussan Ley fighting for her political survival.  The rift centers on new hate speech legislation, which saw three Nationals senators cross the floor—a move that led to their resignations being accepted by Ley. Nationals Leader David Littleproud joins the show to deliver a scathing assessment, accusing Ley of failing to afford his party ""proper process"" and bluntly stating, ""Sussan Ley broke the Coalition."" He argues that the Nationals were forced into an untenable position and had no choice but to stand by their principles.  The tension reaches a boiling point when Opposition Leader Sussan Ley faces a hostile interview with Karl Stefanovic and Sarah Abo. As Ley attempts to defend her decision by citing ""Cabinet solidarity"" and a tough stance on extremism, Stefanovic cuts through the talking points with a brutal question: ""Are you living in some sort of alternate universe?"" With reports circulating that her leadership is now ""terminal,"" Ley struggles to maintain a unified front while admitting the opposition is in disarray.  Watch the full breakdown of this historic political collapse, including the tense exchanges that reveal just how deep the divide has become between the two conservative parties.  Featured in this video:  David Littleproud (Nationals Leader) on why the partnership failed.  Sussan Ley (Opposition Leader) defending her leadership against calls to quit.  Karl Stefanovic & Sarah Abo delivering hard-hitting questions on the Coalition's future.  | *Subscribe and 🔔: http://9Soci.al/KM6e50GjSK9*    *Get more breaking news at 9News.com.au: http://9Soci.al/iyCO50GjSK6*  FOLLOW 9News Australia ► Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/9News/ ► Twitter: https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS ► Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/9news/  Join 9News for the latest in news and events that affect you in your local city, as well as news from across Australia and the world.  #9News #BreakingNews #NineNewsAustralia #9NewsAU",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1A_bLIg4qY,9News
