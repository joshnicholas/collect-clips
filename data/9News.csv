2025-12-12T11:00:04+00:00,9News Sydney | Friday December 12 | Full Episode,"Mark Burrows leads the bulletin with the tragic car crash involving medical student Lydia Fa'amau, an innocent victim fighting for her life in Liverpool Hospital after a police pursuit crash, with a 17-year-old allegedly behind the wheel of a stolen ute facing charges. Next, ""Crocodile Wrangler"" Matt Wright has been sentenced to 10 months in prison and a $5,000 fine for attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to a 2022 fatal helicopter crash, though he has filed an appeal. In politics, the Albanese government has committed hundreds of millions to save 1,000 jobs at Tomago Aluminium with subsidised energy, while state Health Ministers reject a $23 billion hospital funding deal, demanding more from the Commonwealth to address bed block and aged care issues. The Prime Minister is also under pressure, ordering a review of parliamentary entitlements following a spending scandal. The bulletin also covers a Sydney court case where the CEO of Wahlburgers Australia, Sam Mustaca, was found guilty of two counts of common assault against an employee, which was captured on CCTV. Other segments include the guilty plea of a former childcare worker/police officer, an emotional defense from the parents of convicted rapist Tom Silvagni, a chaotic near-miss in Carlingford traffic, an unusual surge in flu cases driven by a new variant, and preparations for a busy Christmas holiday travel period at Sydney Airport.
